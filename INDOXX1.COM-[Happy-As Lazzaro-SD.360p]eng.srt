00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,891
Lazzaro!

2
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,024
Lazzaro, are you staring into the void?

3
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,276
Come on, they're waiting.

4
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:51,904
Tidy your hair at least.

5
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,538
Let's go.

6
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,673
Marin], gimme the light bulb, please.

7
00:02:10,923 --> 00:02:13,050
No! I told you, it's our turn!

8
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,636
- But everyone there is sleeping.
- They've woken up.

9
00:02:15,678 --> 00:02:17,513
I hope it blows!

10
00:02:19,557 --> 00:02:22,143
Mum, could I have the one
from the kitchen?

11
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,311
No one touches that one.

12
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:27,189
- Anyway, what do you need it for?
- To see!

13
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:29,441
Let me sleep, please.

14
00:02:36,448 --> 00:02:39,535
Oh, Mariagrazia...

15
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,583
Mariagrazia!

16
00:02:46,417 --> 00:02:48,836
Listen, they're singing for Mariagrazia.

17
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,421
Listen...

18
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:57,928
They're saying you've got a fat ass.

19
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,471
Have I got a fat ass?

20
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,557
Go on, go to the window!

21
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,350
Gimme the light bulb!

22
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,482
Thank god!

23
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:14,195
- Aren't you gonna go?
- No.

24
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,947
- Sure?
- Of course I'm sure.

25
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,240
Okay then.

26
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:20,576
What are you doing?

27
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,744
I'm going.

28
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,454
No, Antonia!

29
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:26,498
Please, Antonia.

30
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:34,131
What's all this noise about?

31
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:36,759
Call Mariagrazia!

32
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,344
She can't.

33
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:40,596
- Why not?
- She's sick.

34
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,598
Sick how?

35
00:03:42,765 --> 00:03:44,767
She's got an incurable disease.

36
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,143
Should I be worried?

37
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:48,729
It's that she can't... move her ass.

38
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,653
Come on, Giuseppe...

39
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,030
Are you crazy?

40
00:03:58,864 --> 00:03:59,907
Tonight?

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,533
It's now or never.

42
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:08,415
My little rice flower

43
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:14,546
You're like a carnation in a vase

44
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,638
You're like a carnation in a vase

45
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:29,061
You bring the angels down from heaven

46
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,825
Ah, about time.

47
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:49,331
- Shall we drink a toast?
- We haven't got anything.

48
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,417
- We've got Marsala.
- There's hardly any left.

49
00:04:51,542 --> 00:04:53,335
As long as we drink something.

50
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,840
Lazzaro, get Grandma,
bring her to the table.

51
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,853
Cheers!

52
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:12,062
All the best!

53
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,067
I'm thirsty...

54
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:19,486
Who drinks alone, will choke.

55
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,950
Let me have a drink.

56
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,246
Cheers!

57
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,334
There's a bit left.

58
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:38,380
None left.

59
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,216
Doesn't matter.

60
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:43,510
You expecting to eat too?

61
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:47,514
Don't give them the anchovies.

62
00:05:50,351 --> 00:05:53,896
The happy couple should eat first
or it's bad luck.

63
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,523
You're like a bunch of hungry animals.

64
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:03,864
Can I just say a few words?

65
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:13,040
Seeing as we're all here,

66
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,541
I wanted to tell you that...

67
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:18,921
me and Mariagrazia,
we thought we'd...

68
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,926
we'd leave Inviolata.

69
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,930
To see if city life is any better.

70
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:29,306
They are nuts!

71
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:30,682
I don't blame you.

72
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:36,188
And this one?

73
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:38,690
What's this doing here?

74
00:06:39,191 --> 00:06:41,193
- Did you close the chicken coop?
- Yes.

75
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,570
Lazzaro!

76
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,031
Grab this hen, will you?

77
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:48,659
Put her back with the others.

78
00:07:04,341 --> 00:07:05,801
What are you doing?

79
00:07:05,843 --> 00:07:07,344
She got out.

80
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,724
What's going on up there?

81
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:14,435
They're celebrating.

82
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,229
Lucky them! Having fun!

83
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:19,690
Is there anything to eat?

84
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,233
Yes.

85
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:25,487
Seeing as you're already here,

86
00:07:25,571 --> 00:07:28,323
would you cover my shift
looking out for the wolf?

87
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:29,992
Sure.

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,494
I'll close you in, keep you safe.

89
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,746
If I need to go somewhere?

90
00:07:34,872 --> 00:07:35,873
Call me!

91
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,625
Call me and I'll come down.

92
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,211
Got it? Call me.

93
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,393
Carletto?

94
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,229
Carletto!

95
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:20,250
He can't hear me.

96
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:29,426
HAPPY AS LAZZARO

97
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,432
They threw him in a pit with two lions.

98
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,809
They were big lions too!

99
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:41,021
But they didn't eat him.

100
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:43,398
So the guards got mad

101
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,151
and decided to torture him even more.

102
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,570
They wanted to cut his head off.

103
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:51,907
You know what they did to it?

104
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:54,952
They sharpened the axe

105
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,204
until it was gleaming...

106
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,457
And then...

107
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,543
Pippo!

108
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,212
Lazzaro, spit it out!

109
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,466
You Okay?

110
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,842
Thanks.

111
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:12,970
Don't thank me, he almost killed you!

112
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,976
Mariagrazia... let's go!

113
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:20,310
Coming!

114
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:33,865
Lazzaro!

115
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:39,931
Hey everyone...

116
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,558
Nicola is here.

117
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,657
Hey, Catirre!

118
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,701
Here we are.

119
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,079
Catirre, you sunbathing?

120
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:03,789
It's good for the bones!

121
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:05,082
Where are the kids?

122
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:07,584
Hey kids, come here, line up...

123
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,170
Get in line.

124
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:14,049
Let the little children come to me.

125
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,717
This is for you.

126
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,221
Come here, you rascal.

127
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:21,682
You want a sweet?

128
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:24,184
Come here, you little thug!

129
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:27,604
Angelica.

130
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,731
Here you are!

131
00:11:29,981 --> 00:11:31,108
Stefania!

132
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:33,985
Here you are!

133
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,487
You're a big girl...

134
00:11:37,489 --> 00:11:39,199
You already got one!

135
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:43,245
Come on, Father Severino,
we need to bless the thresher...

136
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:45,497
Come on, we haven't got all day.

137
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:49,126
Let's do this blessing.
Let's go there, where the tree is.

138
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:51,086
The Lord sees and provides for us.

139
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:52,838
Mariuccia!
How are things?

140
00:11:52,879 --> 00:11:54,131
Bad, Nicola, bad!

141
00:11:54,506 --> 00:11:57,384
What did you bring us today this time?
Did you bring more light bulbs?

142
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,094
Why do you need light bulbs

143
00:11:59,136 --> 00:12:02,889
with this beautiful moon you have here?
And it leads you into temptation...

144
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:06,101
Look at how this baby looks like me,
did you ever notice?

145
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,644
Always fooling around.

146
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,148
Lazzaro, come on, grab the crate,
bring it inside.

147
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:14,401
Come on, you're usually
the quickest, the most energetic.

148
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,616
The others need to look and learn.

149
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:38,675
Be good.

150
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:41,553
Now let's bless this thresher too.

151
00:12:48,769 --> 00:12:50,687
Now this is what you call wine!

152
00:12:50,812 --> 00:12:52,272
Wine from Inviolata!

153
00:12:52,564 --> 00:12:57,194
In the big city, flavours
get contaminated, spoiled...

154
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,321
This is what being rich is about,

155
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:04,159
our stuff doesn't taste of anything.
You have proper wine, proper bread!

156
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,662
That's why you snatch
real bread out of our mouths.

157
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,831
If only the Marquise knew
how well I treat you,

158
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,918
I treat you all
like a bunch of marquises!

159
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:16,463
She'd throw me off the cliff...
That woman...

160
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,465
what is it you call her?

161
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:21,218
Come on, I know it.
What is it you call her?

162
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,427
Come on, tell me.

163
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,804
The poison viper.

164
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:31,228
The poison viper, yes,
that old pork rind...

165
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,480
The poison viper?

166
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:37,192
Right, let's do some maths here.

167
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,735
So...

168
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:59,589
Five crates of tobacco...

169
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,217
then there are the pulses,

170
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,471
a bushel of lentils...

171
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,893
two bushels of chick peas...

172
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,147
Can we take that baby away, please?

173
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,276
So if I subtract...

174
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:22,153
a roll of wire fencing, the gasoline...

175
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:28,159
the anchovies, the household goods...

176
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,286
We have...

177
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:33,748
The capons? Where are...

178
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,792
They're all dead.

179
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,171
All dead?

180
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:42,132
The wolf got them.

181
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:45,385
Wolf or no wolf...
the capons are missing,

182
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,929
thus I have to add them to the debts.

183
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:52,392
So this month, too...
the debt increases.

184
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:56,146
So this month again
we worked for nothing.

185
00:14:56,313 --> 00:14:58,189
We should break this rat's legs!

186
00:14:58,690 --> 00:14:59,941
And I warn you...

187
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:05,530
the viper...
is about to come.

188
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,282
So... Antonia?

189
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:10,660
The curtains must be washed, eh!
Not like the other time.

190
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:12,787
So, Father Severino...

191
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:17,042
Nicola, it's better if you come
because there's a big problem.

192
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,839
What happens here?

193
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,594
What are you doing...
up there?

194
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:29,220
We want to...

195
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,098
And you think you can just go like that?

196
00:15:32,557 --> 00:15:36,186
You can't.
You need the Marquise's permission!

197
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:40,315
And then you know what would happen
to your families.

198
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:41,942
Is that what you want to do?

199
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,610
To your families?

200
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:49,074
The mistress is sending us
all away, it's not a joke?

201
00:15:57,874 --> 00:15:59,376
Let's go?

202
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,961
And where are we going?

203
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,630
We first need
the Marquise's permission.

204
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,757
Come on, get down.

205
00:16:14,391 --> 00:16:16,101
Let's go, Father Severino.

206
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,770
Where's Lazzaro?

207
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:20,522
Hey, kid!

208
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,732
What are you doing?

209
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,484
Catch him!

210
00:16:25,276 --> 00:16:27,112
He took my mirror!

211
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,973
Move it, Lazzaro.

212
00:17:37,223 --> 00:17:39,100
- Are you tired'?
- No.

213
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,735
Good boy.

214
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,737
Get a move on, you two!

215
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,879
Look what I brought you.

216
00:18:10,215 --> 00:18:12,133
- Your coffee.
- Thanks.

217
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,261
Get yourself home now, go on!

218
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,765
Hello?

219
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,391
Yes, my lady Marquise.

220
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,393
I beg your pardon.

221
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:25,021
Lazzaro, get yourself home, go on!

222
00:18:36,658 --> 00:18:38,493
Pippo, did you know Antonia is dead?

223
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,994
Where's Antonia, Pippo?

224
00:18:40,245 --> 00:18:42,288
She fell down the cliff.

225
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,624
You are all alone now.

226
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:47,043
She told me
she couldn't take anymore of you.

227
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:50,672
- Look how ugly he is when he cries.
- Look, he's really crying.

228
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:55,635
She killed herself,
she couldn't stand you anymore.

229
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,768
Ah, see? She came back after all!

230
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:08,064
He believed us.

231
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,318
He thought she really had died.

232
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:15,572
Who is it?

233
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,950
It's Lazzaro.

234
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,452
You really scared us.

235
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:26,666
- Got something to tell us?
- No.

236
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,459
As usual?

237
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,553
Erm... do you want coffee?

238
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,472
There's a good boy,
go make us some coffee!

239
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,313
Right, I'm leaving.

240
00:20:18,509 --> 00:20:22,222
Mummy, please,
let me go back with him.

241
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:23,514
Luigi.

242
00:20:23,598 --> 00:20:26,142
Whatever! Let me go back with him.

243
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,019
Shut up! You're coming with me.

244
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,274
The fresh air will do you good.

245
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,531
You're late.

246
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:42,742
Forgive me, Madam Alfonsina.

247
00:20:42,784 --> 00:20:45,370
I took the liberty
of bringing along my daughter,

248
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,748
so she can keep
the young Marquis company.

249
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,802
Come on.

250
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,320
Come.

251
00:21:25,576 --> 00:21:26,661
Pippo!

252
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,179
Come.

253
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:51,477
I'm going to show you something.

254
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:01,112
Look.

255
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,618
Cutlery.

256
00:22:07,702 --> 00:22:10,747
Yes, but it's expensive cutlery.
There's a lot of it, isn't there?

257
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:11,956
Yes!

258
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:14,751
All this cutlery,
and she never once invited us for lunch.

259
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,629
Come.

260
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:31,768
This way?

261
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,478
Yes, go on in.

262
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,147
Put it down there.

263
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,405
Help me.

264
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,291
You wondering who she is?

265
00:22:56,417 --> 00:22:58,044
It's Saint Agatha.

266
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:06,052
She was horribly tortured
because of her faith;

267
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:08,554
first they cut off her breasts
with pincers,

268
00:23:09,305 --> 00:23:11,432
then they wanted to roast her.

269
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,817
This one was murdered too.

270
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,572
The Marquise told me these things.

271
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:02,358
Ah, here he is!

272
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:04,986
Nice jacket, where'd you get it?

273
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:06,571
Here?

274
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:08,990
Madam...

275
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,826
Be careful!

276
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,454
On the other side, Antonia.

277
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,830
Obviously.

278
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:19,834
Serve on the left,
collect from the right.

279
00:24:20,501 --> 00:24:21,836
Yes, Madam.

280
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,262
- Where are the curtains, Antonia?
- They're drying, ma'am.

281
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,724
- You should have washed them earlier!
- Yes, ma'am!

282
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,517
Go away from here!

283
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:42,023
Well?

284
00:24:42,482 --> 00:24:44,901
It's all this negative publicity, ma'am.

285
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:48,112
They've started this campaign now,
we've got everyone against us.

286
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:51,491
People are quitting smoking
for health reasons.

287
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,910
Let's be honest,
when it comes to health...

288
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:56,537
we're all at God's mercy, right?

289
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,664
We're at God's mercy...

290
00:24:58,873 --> 00:25:00,791
Of course? God's mercy.

291
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,502
Tobacco isn't what it used to be...

292
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:05,546
and here at Inviolata...

293
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:07,548
Antonia, bring the cheese.

294
00:25:12,053 --> 00:25:14,013
Here at Inviolata, it's not...

295
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:15,181
Put that thing away.

296
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,933
It's not a bed of roses...

297
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,809
It doesn't work anyway.

298
00:25:19,185 --> 00:25:20,186
The farmers...

299
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,647
There's no signal, it's pointless.

300
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,774
...they're plotting something...

301
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,818
Come on, Stefania.

302
00:25:33,824 --> 00:25:36,536
Mum, can I eat a bit?

303
00:25:36,827 --> 00:25:38,287
Just a tiny bit!

304
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:40,039
Just a tiny bit!

305
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,458
- I want some too.
- Hush! No!

306
00:25:56,597 --> 00:25:59,225
Now go home, both of you, go!

307
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:03,062
Go on!

308
00:26:05,815 --> 00:26:08,943
We cannot close our eyes.

309
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,611
This place is falling apart.

310
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:12,989
Antonia, stand up straight, come on!

311
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,865
Straighten that back!

312
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,619
Do you think she loves me'?

313
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:22,373
Of course, sir.

314
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:24,333
She's your mother!

315
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,461
Then if you love me, let me go.

316
00:26:27,628 --> 00:26:29,255
I'm dying here.

317
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:34,093
Ercole!

318
00:26:37,013 --> 00:26:38,139
Ercole...

319
00:26:38,514 --> 00:26:39,890
Good day.

320
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:21,432
Would you like some?

321
00:27:22,016 --> 00:27:23,267
No, thanks.

322
00:27:27,563 --> 00:27:28,814
Ercole's hungry.

323
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,441
Right.

324
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,695
Come on.

325
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,533
He doesn't like it.

326
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,164
Aren't you feeling well?

327
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,084
Yes...

328
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,670
I've got a cough.

329
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:52,672
Smoker's cough.

330
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,466
When I get it, I have to
smoke immediately.

331
00:27:57,218 --> 00:28:00,971
And when I smoke,
I need a coffee, so...

332
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:03,099
I know where I can make coffee.

333
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,585
Can you carry Ercole a bit?

334
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:04,535
What is this place?

335
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,288
A place I come to...

336
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,292
It's got everything.
I've got coffee here, a kitchen...

337
00:29:11,375 --> 00:29:12,793
I come to rest...

338
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,253
Here?

339
00:29:14,545 --> 00:29:17,298
No! There are sheep in there,

340
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,674
over there.

341
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,012
- Can I put him down?
- Yeah, sure.

342
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:29,143
Here?

343
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:30,311
Yes.

344
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,815
Cool, I like it.

345
00:29:36,192 --> 00:29:37,777
Yes, it's nice.

346
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:40,821
This is some place
you've found yourself...

347
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:13,854
I was wondering...

348
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,231
Does Nicola...

349
00:30:15,564 --> 00:30:18,734
know that instead of working,
you come here to relax?

350
00:30:19,235 --> 00:30:20,694
To do nothing?

351
00:30:23,739 --> 00:30:26,116
That's not how it is...
I'm a good worker.

352
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:30,246
So why are you having coffee
instead of working with the others?

353
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,957
Because you ordered me to.

354
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,122
Lazzaro!

355
00:31:14,373 --> 00:31:15,499
Goodnight!

356
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,167
Lazzaro, you unload it!

357
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,183
Lazzaro, bring Grandma up!

358
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,950
Aren't you afraid?

359
00:31:50,326 --> 00:31:51,660
Of what?

360
00:31:53,329 --> 00:31:55,581
That they find out the truth.

361
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,713
Human beings are like animals.

362
00:32:02,922 --> 00:32:07,343
Set them free and they realize
they are slaves

363
00:32:07,426 --> 00:32:10,304
locked in their own misery.

364
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,724
Right now, they suffer,
but they don't know.

365
00:32:14,475 --> 00:32:16,226
Lovely words...

366
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,854
Look. See him?

367
00:32:19,605 --> 00:32:23,192
I exploit them,
they exploit that poor man.

368
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,486
It's a chain reaction
that can't be stopped.

369
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,865
Maybe he doesn't take advantage
of anyone.

370
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,076
That's impossible.

371
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:01,981
Put 'em in straight
or you jam the thresher, come on!

372
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,667
Lazzaro, come here!

373
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:26,046
Go and give them a hand down there,
go on!

374
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:32,302
Get a move on,

375
00:33:32,386 --> 00:33:33,637
go on!

376
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:39,768
Use some elbow grease, come on!

377
00:34:04,585 --> 00:34:07,463
Did you really believe,
oh poison viper impure,

378
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,340
that I could not get the antidote?

379
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:14,928
I have always managed to find the cure
in the hair of the dog that bit me!

380
00:34:15,345 --> 00:34:17,723
What you throw at me is bullshit pure,

381
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,184
you hope that your veil won't let me see

382
00:34:20,309 --> 00:34:22,478
that your talent does not linger

383
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:25,564
and all you have slips
through your fingers.

384
00:34:35,365 --> 00:34:37,242
Can I get a drop of that?

385
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,955
And you?

386
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,874
- You lot not drinking?
- Yeah, right...

387
00:34:44,249 --> 00:34:46,001
- Go on, have a drink.
- No, no.

388
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,253
Give some to Antonia, she's thirsty.

389
00:34:48,378 --> 00:34:50,130
I am not thirsty!

390
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,258
Come on, drink it down, Antonia.

391
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,512
More, more.

392
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,763
Drink up...

393
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,520
Anyone seen the young Marquis?

394
00:35:07,397 --> 00:35:09,983
Has anyone seen the young Marquis?

395
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:11,485
Nobody?

396
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:16,782
Like I had nothing better to do
after a day's work.

397
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:18,158
You haven't seen him?

398
00:35:18,242 --> 00:35:21,370
Dad, I'm scared.
What if he's lost?

399
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,288
No, he's not lost, he's just a moron.

400
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:26,291
I bet he went into town on foot.
No need to fret.

401
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,418
- Let's hope not.
- Why?

402
00:35:28,669 --> 00:35:30,170
This place is crawling with wolves.

403
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:33,132
- What?
- Wolves, wolves that eat.

404
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:37,553
No, no, don't worry.

405
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,054
We'll find him, we'll find him.

406
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,807
We need to find him.
Come on, let's start looking!

407
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,392
Let's call him!

408
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,019
Tancredâ!

409
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:49,773
Tancredâ!

410
00:35:51,942 --> 00:35:53,902
Call louder!

411
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:57,781
Look down there.

412
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,074
Shout!

413
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:00,826
Louder!

414
00:36:34,318 --> 00:36:36,195
Wait, Teresa, wait for me.

415
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,738
I wanna go away, too.

416
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,490
Wait, Teresa honey, stop!

417
00:36:43,327 --> 00:36:44,870
Come on, now we're going back home,

418
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,081
he'll come back, no worries!

419
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,626
What are you looking at?

420
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,086
Don't you have work to do?
Come on!

421
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:19,613
Well?

422
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,407
What's up? Something wrong?

423
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:25,035
You scared me.

424
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:27,496
And I thought you were
my brave fellow.

425
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:30,540
Got anything to eat?

426
00:37:44,805 --> 00:37:48,392
Lucky you're here.
You have no idea...

427
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:50,060
everyone's looking for you.

428
00:37:50,185 --> 00:37:51,937
Didn't you hear the shouts?

429
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,273
Calling all night.

430
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,565
Yeah, I did.

431
00:37:55,691 --> 00:37:57,776
Come on, I'll take you home.

432
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:00,320
No, I'm never going back home.

433
00:38:00,654 --> 00:38:01,905
Why not?

434
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:03,699
Because I was kidnapped.

435
00:38:04,283 --> 00:38:05,659
Who kidnapped you?

436
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,703
You!

437
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,206
What do you mean?

438
00:38:11,290 --> 00:38:13,083
It means you're in trouble.

439
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:17,087
First off,
you have to swear to keep it secret.

440
00:38:17,212 --> 00:38:19,423
Because what you're doing
is against the law.

441
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:22,592
My mother mustn't know
that we're in this together.

442
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:23,719
But she's worried.

443
00:38:23,802 --> 00:38:25,220
Oh, let her worry!

444
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:28,223
She's a torturer, an exploiter,
a bitch!

445
00:38:28,473 --> 00:38:30,726
She thinks you're just animals.

446
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,729
And you and I have fight
with her,

447
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:35,188
like?

448
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,234
Like knights of old.

449
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,363
Oh! Goodly truth in cavaliers of old!

450
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:46,491
Rivals they were,
to different faith were bred.

451
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,244
Not yet the weary warriors'
wounds were cold

452
00:38:49,369 --> 00:38:52,372
Still smarting from those strokes
so fell and dread.

453
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:58,003
Yet they together ride by waste
and rolling hills,

454
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,757
And, unsuspecting,
devious dingle thread.

455
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,761
You do it too!

456
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:09,848
"Dear Mother..."

457
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:12,142
Or maybe "mummy", better.

458
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:15,395
No, "mother" is drier.

459
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,897
"L have been kidnapped!"

460
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,149
"My life is in serious danger."

461
00:39:19,274 --> 00:39:21,026
"You have to put a billion lire..."

462
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:24,780
"in a suitcase and leave it
wherever you find this letter."

463
00:39:24,905 --> 00:39:27,032
"Please help me!"

464
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:30,911
"Your... beloved..."

465
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,539
"Tancredi."

466
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:37,751
Nice.

467
00:39:39,169 --> 00:39:41,171
Now it needs to be signed in blood.

468
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:45,675
Have you got something sharp,
a needle, a knife?

469
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:47,010
I've got a knife.

470
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,193
I'm gonna do this, okay?

471
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:17,082
I can't.

472
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,835
You cut me.

473
00:40:20,794 --> 00:40:21,837
As you like it.

474
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,966
Can we drop the formalities?

475
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:27,300
Okay.

476
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,099
Are you really gonna cut me?

477
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,352
Just how crazy are you?!

478
00:40:56,621 --> 00:40:58,081
I was wondering...

479
00:41:02,127 --> 00:41:03,503
I don't suppose...

480
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:06,631
you could cut yourself?

481
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:08,133
Just a little cut?

482
00:41:08,633 --> 00:41:10,260
Just so we can have some blood?

483
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:11,595
Of course.

484
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,765
Were the eggs laid this morning?

485
00:41:56,806 --> 00:41:57,891
Of course.

486
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,560
Where did you find it?

487
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,187
In the chicken coop.

488
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,565
Now off you go.

489
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,570
Dad, give me the phone.

490
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,906
It's pointless, there's no network here.

491
00:42:12,948 --> 00:42:15,283
I'll go to the bridge.
Let's call the Carabinieri.

492
00:42:15,408 --> 00:42:17,285
The Carabinieri, what Carabinieri?!

493
00:42:17,661 --> 00:42:19,913
First, let's figure out what to do.

494
00:42:19,955 --> 00:42:21,081
We're not doing anything.

495
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:24,292
What do you mean?

496
00:42:24,334 --> 00:42:25,460
Dad...

497
00:42:25,835 --> 00:42:29,339
It's just the latest
of his many stupid tricks.

498
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:31,800
Like when he pretended to have leprosy

499
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,970
or the story
of the plane that had crashed.

500
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,973
We just need to ignore it, that's all.

501
00:42:38,098 --> 00:42:41,184
Yes, but this time
something strange is in the air,

502
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,311
the labourers are behaving weirdly...

503
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,855
It needs to be ignored, I said.

504
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,863
About time, eh?

505
00:42:58,702 --> 00:43:01,496
Come on! You're taking ages.
Up you come!

506
00:43:02,497 --> 00:43:04,499
Look what I made!

507
00:43:04,958 --> 00:43:06,251
All by myself!

508
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:07,627
Let's try it out.

509
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:17,971
It worked before.

510
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,643
It's broken.

511
00:43:24,603 --> 00:43:26,104
Maybe it can be repaired.

512
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,480
You can have it.

513
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,733
Really?

514
00:43:38,033 --> 00:43:40,035
Lazzaro, kneel!

515
00:43:43,747 --> 00:43:45,498
I bequeath you this weapon,

516
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:48,043
as a sign of our friendship.

517
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,046
Never lose it.

518
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,673
What is it?

519
00:43:55,175 --> 00:43:56,301
A sling.

520
00:43:56,426 --> 00:43:57,761
It is the weapon

521
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,014
to combat all the Marquises
of the world.

522
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,058
What is it?

523
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,310
It's the weapon...

524
00:44:05,810 --> 00:44:08,521
It could come in handy when we leave.

525
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:28,041
Out of all those people?
which ones are your parents?

526
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:29,959
I don't know.

527
00:44:30,418 --> 00:44:32,337
What do you mean, you don't know?

528
00:44:32,462 --> 00:44:34,464
No. I only have a grandma.

529
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:36,466
How can that be?

530
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:38,301
That's just the way it is,

531
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:39,928
but it's fine by me.

532
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:42,597
You told me a lie, you know?

533
00:44:43,807 --> 00:44:45,350
No, I didn't.

534
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,353
You told me
all you have is your grandmother.

535
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:51,064
And that's not true!

536
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,858
You have me!

537
00:44:53,983 --> 00:44:57,112
It wouldn't surprise me
to find out we're half-brothers.

538
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,114
Stand up straight!

539
00:44:59,989 --> 00:45:01,825
We just look alike.

540
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:04,244
My father was a real womanizer.

541
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:08,081
Maybe your mother, as she was washing
clothes at the river...

542
00:45:09,082 --> 00:45:12,585
My father stopped
to let his horse drink,

543
00:45:12,711 --> 00:45:14,254
he approached her...

544
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:18,758
Half-brothers!

545
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,642
Come down here, Lazzaro.

546
00:45:28,101 --> 00:45:29,894
This place is totally cool!

547
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:34,774
Come on, move it!

548
00:45:45,285 --> 00:45:47,162
What's wrong, don't you like it?

549
00:45:47,996 --> 00:45:49,164
It's a ditch.

550
00:45:49,414 --> 00:45:51,249
What do you mean, a ditch?

551
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,918
It looks like the moon!

552
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,713
Hear that?

553
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:42,967
It's the wolf.

554
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:49,307
I wonder what he's saying,
like he's calling someone.

555
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,243
He's answering me.

556
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,994
Go on, you try.

557
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,335
Seriously? Louder!

558
00:47:23,216 --> 00:47:25,093
Go on, project that voice!

559
00:48:29,032 --> 00:48:30,783
What are you doing, standing guard?

560
00:48:30,825 --> 00:48:33,953
When are we gonna finish these leaves?

561
00:48:37,707 --> 00:48:38,708
Here he is.

562
00:48:41,586 --> 00:48:42,962
Where have you been?

563
00:48:45,465 --> 00:48:47,050
With the sheeps.

564
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,551
The wolf was nearby.

565
00:48:48,718 --> 00:48:50,219
We all heard him.

566
00:48:50,303 --> 00:48:51,804
There was more than one.

567
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:54,974
You're lucky they didn't eat you.

568
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:57,977
You just disappeared,
instead of working?

569
00:49:03,566 --> 00:49:05,985
We have to do all the tobacco tomorrow.

570
00:49:06,444 --> 00:49:07,987
There's too much!

571
00:49:08,363 --> 00:49:09,739
How do we do?

572
00:49:11,574 --> 00:49:14,118
Don't disappear again
like you did today, okay?

573
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:51,155
Where are you going?

574
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,407
To work.

575
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:57,370
Did you check
to see if the money was there?

576
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:59,664
Nothing there, I'm sorry.

577
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,375
Stay here.

578
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:05,378
I can't, I have to work.

579
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,547
What am I supposed to do all day?

580
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,674
Go on then...

581
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:12,677
Maybe I can come back later.

582
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:14,637
Don't worry about me!

583
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,189
You're blocking the sun.

584
00:50:33,573 --> 00:50:36,701
A half-brother would never do that!

585
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:24,832
The Marquise is teaching.
Any kids free?

586
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:26,751
We need them here.

587
00:51:30,338 --> 00:51:31,506
Antonia?

588
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,342
Lazzaro's staring into the void again,
go and shake him.

589
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:27,019
He's burning up.

590
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:30,273
He's boiling hot.

591
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,276
He's ready to drop.

592
00:52:34,777 --> 00:52:36,320
He's got fever.

593
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,785
He's dying...

594
00:52:44,287 --> 00:52:45,830
He's done for.

595
00:52:50,543 --> 00:52:52,086
He's gonna die.

596
00:52:52,587 --> 00:52:54,714
He's gonna die, he's gonna die.

597
00:52:54,839 --> 00:52:57,216
- Stefania, come here!
- I burnt my hand on him.

598
00:52:57,341 --> 00:53:00,303
Maybe he went under the cursed tree,

599
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:02,805
or he's playing the innocent.

600
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,473
Yeah, but put him to bed.

601
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:06,100
Where?

602
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:15,610
MariÃ¹, can I put him here?

603
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,994
Isn't there any room for Lazzaro?

604
00:53:25,995 --> 00:53:28,247
What d'ya want? Get lost.

605
00:53:30,208 --> 00:53:32,210
I bring him to Grandma's.

606
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:35,129
Stefania!

607
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:41,093
There's something in the middle
of the woods, what is it?!

608
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:43,846
What is it?

609
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:49,727
- What's going on?
- I reckon it's a tractor.

610
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:52,021
It's witchcraft.

611
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,773
Is it a burning building?

612
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:55,233
What's that?

613
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,151
Is it a moving building?

614
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:29,952
"He who knows himself well"

615
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:33,247
"is humbled in his own presence."

616
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:36,876
"And the praise of other men
provokes no pleasure..."

617
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,255
"If I were to know
everything in the universe"

618
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:43,758
"and scorned the charity"

619
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,385
"who would bring me the grace of God?"

620
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,597
"Who would judge my actions?"

621
00:55:50,097 --> 00:55:53,893
"One should go beyond
the thirst for knowledge"

622
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:56,771
"that is the root of
distraction and disappointment."

623
00:55:56,854 --> 00:55:59,148
- Hello?
- Nicola?

624
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:00,399
Teresa?

625
00:56:00,608 --> 00:56:01,734
Bad!

626
00:56:01,901 --> 00:56:03,527
Listen, I can't talk for long.

627
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:06,030
Tell Mother to leave the cash,

628
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:07,782
or they'll kill me.

629
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,492
They're coming back...

630
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:19,168
What good is knowledge
without a fear of God?"

631
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:24,173
"A humble farmhand is far better
"at serving God"

632
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:28,177
"than the most erudite scholar
who neglects himself and studies..."

633
00:56:28,302 --> 00:56:29,804
Madam?

634
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:33,557
Why are you interrupting me?

635
00:56:34,934 --> 00:56:36,936
Is it so urgent?

636
00:56:37,019 --> 00:56:39,146
Can't you see we're reading?

637
00:56:41,190 --> 00:56:43,567
No... Nothing...

638
00:56:44,443 --> 00:56:45,694
Please excuse me.

639
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:06,465
Hello?

640
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:09,093
Hello, can you hear me?

641
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:13,722
I'm calling about a missing boy.

642
00:57:14,932 --> 00:57:16,976
Someone important, a Marquis,

643
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,936
I'm not kidding.

644
00:57:18,978 --> 00:57:21,355
Honestly? He's been kidnapped.

645
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:23,232
He's been kidnapped...

646
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:24,984
He's a Marquis.

647
00:58:39,892 --> 00:58:43,938
Let me tell you a story,
the story of a wolf.

648
00:58:52,571 --> 00:58:56,283
A very old wolf had become decrepit.

649
00:58:56,408 --> 00:58:59,578
He couldn't hunt wild animals anymore.

650
00:59:00,663 --> 00:59:03,207
So he was excluded from the pack...

651
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:09,296
...And the old wolf went to the houses

652
00:59:09,338 --> 00:59:12,591
to steal animals, chickens, sheep.

653
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:14,969
He was hungry.

654
00:59:23,811 --> 00:59:26,981
The villagers tried to kill him
in every way possible,

655
00:59:27,106 --> 00:59:28,983
but they didn't' succeed.

656
00:59:29,608 --> 00:59:31,735
They stood guard every night.

657
00:59:31,860 --> 00:59:34,697
They set traps, nets...

658
00:59:34,738 --> 00:59:36,740
it was as if he were invisible.

659
01:00:24,163 --> 01:00:26,165
How many people live in here?

660
01:00:26,248 --> 01:00:27,750
Twenty-six in here,

661
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:28,876
eighteen in there,

662
01:00:28,917 --> 01:00:31,754
and not very many in there,
only eight, as grandma lives there.

663
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:35,758
And the kids?

664
01:00:36,175 --> 01:00:39,803
The kids? they're kids.
What about the kids?

665
01:00:39,928 --> 01:00:41,388
No, I mean, school?

666
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:42,640
What school?!

667
01:00:43,307 --> 01:00:44,683
School?

668
01:00:45,267 --> 01:00:46,560
School is for rich folks.

669
01:00:46,810 --> 01:00:48,812
What do you mean 'for rich folks'?

670
01:00:49,688 --> 01:00:51,440
Everyone goes to school!

671
01:00:54,652 --> 01:00:57,279
The men hated him.

672
01:00:57,696 --> 01:01:00,324
They imagined
he was enormous, ferocious...

673
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:06,330
...They couldn't know he was just
an old, hungry wolf.

674
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:09,208
We're the lady's sharecroppers.

675
01:01:10,584 --> 01:01:12,711
- The sharecroppers?
- The Marquise's.

676
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,714
We belong to the Marquise De Luna.

677
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:17,966
Don't you know her?

678
01:01:18,467 --> 01:01:20,969
Sharecropping was outlawed years ago,

679
01:01:21,053 --> 01:01:22,805
there are contracts now, rules!

680
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:24,306
Wages!

681
01:01:26,058 --> 01:01:27,851
You lot should be getting paid.

682
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,561
Paid! We wish!

683
01:01:30,104 --> 01:01:31,980
We're always in debt!

684
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,487
Move forward!

685
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:40,489
Move forward!

686
01:01:43,450 --> 01:01:47,746
Come on, what are you waiting for?
For the water to part?

687
01:01:47,871 --> 01:01:51,208
It's dangerous! I'm scared!

688
01:01:51,458 --> 01:01:53,252
Folks have died doing this!

689
01:01:54,962 --> 01:01:57,131
Eleonora, show them.

690
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:59,216
Look!

691
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:01,510
It's safe,
just a couple of inches of water,

692
01:02:01,593 --> 01:02:04,513
nothing will happen, we put sacks down.

693
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:11,895
These guys are scared
of everything, huh?

694
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:17,776
That's right...

695
01:02:18,902 --> 01:02:21,739
Slowly now, you're totally safe.

696
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:36,295
...There was a rumour of a Saint
who could talk to animals.

697
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:39,923
That they understood,
and obeyed him.

698
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,010
So they went to get him.

699
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:48,056
The Saint agreed to talk to the wolf,

700
01:02:48,557 --> 01:02:50,809
to ask for a truce.

701
01:02:51,435 --> 01:02:53,645
So he set off to find him.

702
01:02:57,065 --> 01:02:58,901
Lazzaro, mum, where is he?

703
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:01,445
- Oh, darling...
- We need to find him!

704
01:03:01,570 --> 01:03:04,281
Stand back!
Careful of the opening doors.

705
01:03:05,824 --> 01:03:07,409
Where are you taking us?

706
01:03:07,451 --> 01:03:12,956
We'll be going to the police station.
To identify everyone.

707
01:03:14,166 --> 01:03:17,961
The Saint walked, for such a long time.

708
01:03:18,462 --> 01:03:20,464
For miles and miles...

709
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,549
Then winter came.

710
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:31,350
The Saint is exhausted.

711
01:03:31,725 --> 01:03:34,228
He's cold, starving.

712
01:03:35,229 --> 01:03:37,356
but he sees no sign of the wolf.

713
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:41,693
He doesn't know that the wolf
is hungry too.

714
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:46,114
And that he's been on his trail
for a while.

715
01:03:56,500 --> 01:04:01,004
The Saint falls,
exhausted, in the snow.

716
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,882
And that's where the wolf finds him.

717
01:05:00,439 --> 01:05:03,901
So the wolf approaches...
he sharpens his claws...

718
01:05:04,651 --> 01:05:07,696
...and teeth,
ready to devour him, but...

719
01:05:09,781 --> 01:05:13,410
he smells something he has
never smelled before, and he stops.

720
01:05:14,077 --> 01:05:15,954
He sniffs him all over.

721
01:05:17,331 --> 01:05:19,458
What was that smell?

722
01:05:21,168 --> 01:05:23,837
It was the smell... of a good man.

723
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:09,317
Look how handsome you are.

724
01:07:12,446 --> 01:07:13,947
Come and see!

725
01:07:14,406 --> 01:07:16,033
We're taking this for sure!

726
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,535
Good.

727
01:07:26,460 --> 01:07:29,963
Hey, you! Don't move!
You'll regret it!

728
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:31,965
Who are you?

729
01:07:33,717 --> 01:07:34,801
Don't you move.

730
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:37,054
I... was looking for the others.

731
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,557
Tancredi, the Marquis.

732
01:07:41,850 --> 01:07:45,353
And this marquis... is he here?

733
01:07:46,229 --> 01:07:47,355
No.

734
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:52,736
Did you have an appointment?

735
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,446
I don't think so.

736
01:07:54,863 --> 01:07:56,364
Do you know each other?

737
01:07:56,490 --> 01:07:59,367
Yes. He's my brother.

738
01:08:00,202 --> 01:08:02,496
I mean... my half-brother.

739
01:08:05,373 --> 01:08:06,750
And you?

740
01:08:07,375 --> 01:08:08,627
Us?

741
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:10,962
We're the removal men.

742
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:14,132
- Right!
- We work for the Marquis.

743
01:08:14,257 --> 01:08:15,759
We have the keys.

744
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:18,720
We're moving the furniture.

745
01:08:19,262 --> 01:08:20,847
Have they moved house?

746
01:08:20,889 --> 01:08:22,015
A long time ago.

747
01:08:25,393 --> 01:08:27,729
Could you tell me where?

748
01:08:29,648 --> 01:08:31,149
We know, of course...

749
01:08:31,274 --> 01:08:34,653
But we can't tell you the address.
It's a question of privacy.

750
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,410
Heavy, isn't it?

751
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:44,371
Can I give you a hand?

752
01:08:45,914 --> 01:08:47,666
Yeah, sure.

753
01:08:47,791 --> 01:08:49,167
Take this,

754
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:51,670
I've got a bit of a bad back...
Take it!

755
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:55,549
But if you injure yourself.
You're not insured, your problem.

756
01:08:55,674 --> 01:08:57,050
Take this...

757
01:09:00,679 --> 01:09:02,013
Go on.

758
01:09:14,568 --> 01:09:15,819
Aren't you taking this?

759
01:09:16,069 --> 01:09:18,196
- The cutlery.
- There it is.

760
01:09:18,405 --> 01:09:19,447
Yeah!

761
01:09:19,698 --> 01:09:20,824
Sure, we're taking it.

762
01:09:24,953 --> 01:09:26,538
Come on, this one.

763
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:28,832
This.

764
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,585
Careful now, it's fragile.
Careful.

765
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:34,087
Good.

766
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:35,338
Come on!

767
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:37,090
The other one.

768
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:40,552
I was just getting this.

769
01:09:42,095 --> 01:09:45,599
Well done, the pan!
They always come in handy.

770
01:09:49,436 --> 01:09:50,937
See ya.

771
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,488
If you see Tancredi,

772
01:10:00,614 --> 01:10:03,742
can you tell him?
that I had the fever?

773
01:10:03,992 --> 01:10:04,993
We will.

774
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,369
That I'm sorry.

775
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:08,246
I'm sorry too. Bye.

776
01:10:10,582 --> 01:10:13,210
- Where are you going?
- Into town.

777
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,506
Sorry...

778
01:10:19,591 --> 01:10:21,593
but... Can I come with you?

779
01:10:21,635 --> 01:10:23,220
What?

780
01:10:23,261 --> 01:10:27,390
Three in the front seat is illegal,
and the back is full?

781
01:10:27,766 --> 01:10:31,895
It's not that far. Look...

782
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,647
I wouldn't say that.

783
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,025
Get yourself onto that road...

784
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,902
then go straight.

785
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,779
Then walk and walk...

786
01:12:26,217 --> 01:12:29,012
Right, the first job...

787
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:32,515
It's an olive grove... 7000 trees,

788
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:36,269
in good condition, average height.

789
01:12:36,394 --> 01:12:38,521
So the price is...

790
01:12:39,397 --> 01:12:42,776
The starting price is...
It's quite high.

791
01:12:42,901 --> 01:12:44,277
It's not a bad price,

792
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:48,365
four euros for a crate of olives.

793
01:12:49,115 --> 01:12:50,992
Come on!
This isn't a bad job.

794
01:12:51,034 --> 01:12:53,495
Come on, folks, who'll offer less?

795
01:12:53,661 --> 01:12:54,788
Three-fifty...

796
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:58,041
No, come on...
That's still too high.

797
01:12:58,166 --> 01:12:59,626
Two-fifty.

798
01:13:00,043 --> 01:13:01,628
We can do better...

799
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:05,882
It's not tiring work, it's a flat field.

800
01:13:05,924 --> 01:13:10,428
This one is a great opportunity...
a big chance.

801
01:13:11,054 --> 01:13:12,555
Two euros!

802
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:14,182
One euro!

803
01:13:14,391 --> 01:13:16,184
One euro. Good woman!

804
01:13:16,267 --> 01:13:17,560
What's your name?

805
01:13:17,685 --> 01:13:19,020
- What's your name?
- Silvana.

806
01:13:19,062 --> 01:13:20,522
Get on that truck.

807
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:24,192
That's right, follow her example!
That's the way to get work.

808
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,444
She's an example for you!

809
01:13:26,945 --> 01:13:29,322
Right, onto the next job...

810
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:30,824
Nicola?

811
01:13:31,324 --> 01:13:33,535
Get back, you! Join the group!

812
01:13:33,827 --> 01:13:37,914
You need to be specialised
to do this work, you know!

813
01:13:37,956 --> 01:13:41,960
This involves chemicals, spraying
the plants. The starting price is...

814
01:13:43,711 --> 01:13:46,172
Nicola, it's me, Lazzaro.

815
01:13:46,589 --> 01:13:48,466
Lazzaro from Inviolata.

816
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:56,808
Go away, get!

817
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,726
Get lost!

818
01:15:20,517 --> 01:15:22,685
Where's the cash? Tell us!

819
01:15:23,645 --> 01:15:26,189
It's not here!
I'm not crazy!

820
01:15:26,314 --> 01:15:28,191
The cash is in the bank!

821
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,155
How the hell did he get here?

822
01:15:34,572 --> 01:15:35,907
On foot.

823
01:15:37,033 --> 01:15:38,409
Get him.

824
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:44,207
Give us the cash or we'll kill him,
right here!

825
01:15:44,582 --> 01:15:46,918
Kill him! Who cares?

826
01:15:46,960 --> 01:15:49,295
He is not my family.

827
01:15:49,337 --> 01:15:51,172
Go on, kill him...

828
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,466
Come on!

829
01:15:53,841 --> 01:15:56,469
- Are you really stealing the crisps?
- Shut it!

830
01:15:57,470 --> 01:15:59,347
They've expired!

831
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:06,563
In there.

832
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:07,981
Get in!

833
01:16:31,879 --> 01:16:33,381
About time!

834
01:16:34,215 --> 01:16:35,508
I know.

835
01:16:39,512 --> 01:16:41,014
Get outta here.

836
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:44,267
Could you tell me the way
to Tancredi's house?

837
01:16:44,851 --> 01:16:48,396
We told you, we can't tell you!
Go on, get outta here.

838
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:51,899
Don't call me darling, you left me
waiting in the freezing cold!

839
01:16:52,483 --> 01:16:54,027
There was snow on the ground.

840
01:17:11,169 --> 01:17:12,670
Lazzaro. ..

841
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:22,180
Lazzaro, is that you?

842
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:25,058
Of course... you know all the bums!

843
01:17:26,059 --> 01:17:29,020
My God...
have I gone out of my mind?

844
01:17:31,189 --> 01:17:32,440
Pippo!

845
01:17:32,565 --> 01:17:34,192
Don't you recognise him?

846
01:17:34,651 --> 01:17:38,529
But how can it be?
He's exactly the same.

847
01:17:53,711 --> 01:17:55,171
You're...

848
01:17:55,672 --> 01:17:57,173
Oh my God!

849
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,552
On your knees.

850
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,307
I told you to get down on your knees.

851
01:18:06,724 --> 01:18:08,685
That's an order. Down.

852
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:21,948
Antonia, what are you doing?

853
01:18:31,874 --> 01:18:33,126
Okay, that's enough.

854
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:36,963
Now that you've had your reunion,
we can go home.

855
01:18:37,964 --> 01:18:42,135
Bye, whatever your name is...
'Lassero'... All the best.

856
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:44,762
- "Lazzaro".
- No, he's coming with us!

857
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:46,514
What?

858
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,725
You're coming with us, right?

859
01:18:48,766 --> 01:18:50,017
Of course!

860
01:18:51,352 --> 01:18:52,895
He needs to warm up...

861
01:18:54,522 --> 01:18:57,233
You're cold, right?

862
01:18:57,775 --> 01:18:59,402
A bit, yes.

863
01:19:00,611 --> 01:19:02,655
Give him your jacket, go on!

864
01:20:18,731 --> 01:20:20,191
Come...

865
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,736
Come with me.

866
01:20:28,449 --> 01:20:30,993
Mum, Dad, Catirre...

867
01:20:31,452 --> 01:20:32,995
Look who it is!

868
01:20:44,006 --> 01:20:46,008
The cat got your tongue?

869
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:48,010
But he was not dead?

870
01:20:48,094 --> 01:20:51,097
- It's like seeing a ghost.
- ls he a ghost?

871
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,600
He is not a ghost!
It's Lazzaro, in the flesh!

872
01:20:54,642 --> 01:20:56,644
Are you some kind of devil?

873
01:21:14,787 --> 01:21:16,539
What did you bring to eat?

874
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:19,000
Not much. Snack.

875
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:22,044
Crisps. Here.

876
01:21:23,254 --> 01:21:26,132
We have another mouth to feed now.

877
01:21:27,425 --> 01:21:29,427
Why, does the devil eat too?

878
01:21:31,762 --> 01:21:33,431
I wish he didn't.

879
01:21:41,814 --> 01:21:43,274
Shall I help?

880
01:21:43,316 --> 01:21:46,569
Get back! Don't touch me.

881
01:21:49,030 --> 01:21:50,197
Here.

882
01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:01,959
I'm not hungry.

883
01:22:02,043 --> 01:22:03,961
I told you ghosts don't eat.

884
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:13,846
Try this on.

885
01:22:14,472 --> 01:22:15,806
Thanks.

886
01:22:23,940 --> 01:22:25,608
And Tancredi?

887
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:28,736
Why has everybody left the Inviolata?

888
01:22:33,824 --> 01:22:35,868
"THE GREAT SWINDLE"

889

905
01:23:58,826 --> 01:24:00,161
Lazzaro. ..

906
01:24:04,957 --> 01:24:06,459
I know, Mum.

907
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:10,588
Anyway, if he wants to stay here,
he has to work.

908
01:24:10,713 --> 01:24:14,550
Even if he's a ghost,
if he wants to eat, he works.

909
01:24:14,717 --> 01:24:16,093
I know, Mum.

910
01:24:16,343 --> 01:24:19,055
- What can he do?
- I dunno.

911
01:24:19,221 --> 01:24:22,224
With that honest face of his,
we can think of something for him to do.

912
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:23,434
I hope so!

913
01:24:48,959 --> 01:24:50,628
I'm begging you Sir...

914
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:53,130
My situation is desperate.

915
01:24:53,255 --> 01:24:55,508
I said no! That's enough!

916
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:58,135
But it's rare, valuable!

917
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:01,514
If the police come to check?

918
01:25:02,264 --> 01:25:03,265
Read this.

919
01:25:03,641 --> 01:25:06,143
- I can't read.
- You can't read?

920
01:25:07,478 --> 01:25:10,397
"No purchases
without a certification of origin."

921
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:13,400
Even if it's worth 200, 300 euros,
I can't touch it.

922
01:25:13,526 --> 01:25:15,361
How do I know it's not stolen?

923
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:17,404
I brought him.

924
01:25:17,613 --> 01:25:19,907
He's my witness...

925
01:25:20,491 --> 01:25:22,159
You could be in league.

926
01:25:22,368 --> 01:25:24,537
Look what honest face!

927
01:25:26,288 --> 01:25:28,791
Please... I beg of you.

928
01:25:28,916 --> 01:25:30,793
I said no!
Now do me a favour and get lost.

929
01:25:30,918 --> 01:25:32,294
Get lost!

930
01:25:32,378 --> 01:25:33,754
Get lost, you tramp!

931
01:25:33,796 --> 01:25:35,005
What a numbskull!

932
01:25:35,047 --> 01:25:38,551
How dare you treat a woman that way!

933
01:25:38,676 --> 01:25:40,678
I'm calling the police!

934
01:25:40,886 --> 01:25:43,430
Who's this? Your accomplice?

935
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,683
Don't you dare touch me like that!

936
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,309
Lout!

937
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:49,895
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

938
01:25:50,062 --> 01:25:52,314
I'm used to worse.

939
01:25:52,815 --> 01:25:54,191
What did he do to you?

940
01:25:54,316 --> 01:25:58,070
I have to sell this,
an antique cigarette holder...

941
01:25:58,279 --> 01:26:00,072
I don't care if it's worth 100 euros.

942
01:26:00,197 --> 01:26:03,450
Tell him!
Tell him who it belonged to.

943
01:26:03,701 --> 01:26:05,953
It belonged to
the Marquise Alfonsina De Luna.

944
01:26:06,787 --> 01:26:08,414
The Cigarette Queen?

945
01:26:08,455 --> 01:26:09,665
Yes.

946
01:26:09,707 --> 01:26:11,417
Was she famous?

947
01:26:11,458 --> 01:26:13,961
Of course, with everything she did.

948
01:26:14,044 --> 01:26:15,087
Tough luck for you!

949
01:26:15,171 --> 01:26:17,214
Thank you for being so kind, madam.

950
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,592
We'll find someone else to buy it.

951
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:24,221
Listen... erm...

952
01:26:24,346 --> 01:26:27,099
maybe I can do something...

953
01:26:28,475 --> 01:26:30,436
I can buy it?

954
01:26:31,103 --> 01:26:32,479
Is twenty euros enough?

955
01:26:32,605 --> 01:26:34,690
Twenty euros isn't much. This...

956
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:37,359
I mean, it's really valuable,

957
01:26:37,484 --> 01:26:39,361
it's worth at least fifty.

958
01:26:41,113 --> 01:26:42,489
Thirty euros?

959
01:26:44,366 --> 01:26:45,492
Thirty euros?

960
01:26:45,576 --> 01:26:48,746
Okay, thanks.

961
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:52,082
- Shall I wrap it for you?
- Yes.

962
01:26:52,249 --> 01:26:55,961
I'm sorry, ma'am...
but the certification of origin...

963
01:26:56,086 --> 01:26:57,254
But it doesn't matter.

964
01:26:57,463 --> 01:26:59,006
Not for me.

965
01:26:59,131 --> 01:27:00,758
I trust the lady.

966
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:02,593
But the certification

967
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,137
is important for the professionals...

968
01:27:05,346 --> 01:27:06,972
- There's no problem...
- Come and see...

969
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:08,349
There you are.

970
01:27:08,641 --> 01:27:09,642
You sure?

971
01:27:09,767 --> 01:27:11,894
Thank you, all the best.

972
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,980
Goodbye.

973
01:27:26,867 --> 01:27:29,495
I think we deserve a nice beer,
don't you?

974
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:37,419
- Have you got beer?
- Yes. Two euros.

975
01:27:37,503 --> 01:27:39,505
Two? Are you out of your head?

976
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,632
One euro? Even too much.

977
01:27:46,011 --> 01:27:47,263
Shall I open it?

978
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:48,430
Yeah.

979
01:27:57,064 --> 01:28:00,192
What's this?
Didn't we give it to the lady?

980
01:28:02,027 --> 01:28:03,195
See?

981
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:05,572
A magic trick.

982
01:28:08,075 --> 01:28:09,159
Let's go.

983
01:28:41,608 --> 01:28:43,861
Hey, pick up all the rubbish
and burn it!

984
01:29:30,783 --> 01:29:33,410
Tomorrow we'll sell it elsewhere.

985
01:29:33,535 --> 01:29:35,621
A nice object.
It's simple to sell.

986
01:29:36,163 --> 01:29:37,247
Quickly.

987
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,249
I don't want Lazzaro with me anymore.

988
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:40,918
Why not?

989
01:29:41,001 --> 01:29:43,170
- He was perfect.
- He's no use.

990
01:29:44,171 --> 01:29:45,172
Am I dreaming?

991
01:29:45,297 --> 01:29:46,924
Sugar, you're so erratic,

992
01:29:47,007 --> 01:29:49,176
first you need him...

993
01:29:49,301 --> 01:29:51,387
And now I say he's no use.

994
01:29:51,762 --> 01:29:54,306
That lady fell for it
because I played well.

995
01:29:54,390 --> 01:29:56,934
We'll go, and he stays here.

996
01:29:57,017 --> 01:29:58,769
Whatever.

997
01:29:58,936 --> 01:30:00,896
Not here, he's bad luck.

998
01:30:00,938 --> 01:30:04,817
Send him away from here.
Send him away, he's useless here.

999
01:30:04,942 --> 01:30:08,070
Stop it. Should I dump him
in the middle of the road?

1000
01:30:08,195 --> 01:30:09,696
Just get rid of him.

1001
01:30:23,585 --> 01:30:24,795
Potatoes?

1002
01:30:26,088 --> 01:30:27,714
Where did you find the potatoes?

1003
01:30:27,798 --> 01:30:30,426
They were growing over there,
by the wall...

1004
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:36,348
Come! Come!

1005
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:40,352
Can we eat this too?

1006
01:30:40,477 --> 01:30:42,438
Yes, these are nettles,

1007
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:45,816
you can fry it with garlic,
like chicory.

1008
01:30:46,358 --> 01:30:47,359
That one.

1009
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:48,610
Which one?

1010
01:30:50,821 --> 01:30:52,114
That's chicory?

1011
01:30:52,739 --> 01:30:54,116
And you can eat it?

1012
01:30:56,243 --> 01:30:57,953
You can't eat that, right?

1013
01:30:57,995 --> 01:31:00,747
Not that one. That's a weed.

1014
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:03,000
That one. That's a mullein.

1015
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,252
You can boil it.

1016
01:31:05,711 --> 01:31:07,129
Unbelievable.

1017
01:31:09,256 --> 01:31:11,717
And this? This yellow thing here...

1018
01:31:12,634 --> 01:31:15,137
That's wild carrot, but it's not ripe.

1019
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:17,764
Wild carrot?

1020
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:21,268
Jeez... all this stuff
just growing everywhere, for free!!

1021
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:24,605
If I'd known!
It's as if... as if...

1022
01:31:24,897 --> 01:31:27,107
we're just walking on a treasure!

1023
01:31:32,112 --> 01:31:33,405
Come with me.

1024
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,034
What a discovery...

1025
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:39,411
He's struck gold.

1026
01:32:01,016 --> 01:32:02,059
Tasty, eh?

1027
01:32:02,184 --> 01:32:03,769
Very tasty.

1028
01:32:03,810 --> 01:32:05,938
Yes, very good.

1029
01:32:06,063 --> 01:32:07,564
Careful, it's hot.

1030
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:11,944
Sorry,

1031
01:32:12,444 --> 01:32:15,322
but you all knew...
and you never told me

1032
01:32:15,447 --> 01:32:18,408
that there was
all this stuff to eat?

1033
01:32:18,700 --> 01:32:19,701
We can pick it!

1034
01:32:19,826 --> 01:32:21,703
You can't imagine
how much we've picked.

1035
01:32:21,787 --> 01:32:22,955
Not anymore.

1036
01:32:24,081 --> 01:32:27,334
I worked all my life...
It's heavy going working the earth.

1037
01:32:27,459 --> 01:32:28,460
I know.

1038
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:31,547
I wouldn't even pick an onion.
Pick it yourself!

1039
01:32:31,588 --> 01:32:33,090
I get it, folks...

1040
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:35,801
but maybe...
we could make some cash!

1041
01:32:37,302 --> 01:32:39,972
We could put it into bunches,

1042
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:42,099
and sell them to the market, right?

1043
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,226
Of course.

1044
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:46,103
Do it yourself, if you want.

1045
01:32:46,228 --> 01:32:47,813
No one's stopping you.

1046
01:32:47,854 --> 01:32:49,606
But we sure ain't gonna help.

1047
01:32:49,731 --> 01:32:51,108
No, we're not helping.

1048
01:32:51,191 --> 01:32:52,234
Alright.

1049
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:54,987
I'll do it alone.

1050
01:32:59,241 --> 01:33:01,827
- Want some oil?
- Just a drop...

1051
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:03,996
Thanks, darling.

1052
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:29,271
Jeez, what is that shit?

1053
01:33:33,358 --> 01:33:36,486
Ugly piece of shit!

1054
01:33:38,739 --> 01:33:39,906
Oh my God!

1055
01:33:39,990 --> 01:33:41,283
What's happened to you?

1056
01:33:42,618 --> 01:33:43,994
Did you get tangled up?

1057
01:33:46,663 --> 01:33:47,748
There.

1058
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:49,291
Think you can walk?

1059
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:55,297
Ercole!

1060
01:33:58,675 --> 01:34:00,510
Where are you?

1061
01:34:00,802 --> 01:34:02,429
Ercole!

1062
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:22,949
Ercole, come on.

1063
01:34:23,659 --> 01:34:24,826
Come on.

1064
01:34:25,827 --> 01:34:27,079
Come here.

1065
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:31,416
Good boy, you made it.

1066
01:35:02,698 --> 01:35:03,949
Tancredi?

1067
01:35:06,243 --> 01:35:08,120
Tancredi, it's me.

1068
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:11,623
Don't you recognise me?

1069
01:35:16,002 --> 01:35:17,003
Look!

1070
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:33,019
You?

1071
01:35:33,395 --> 01:35:34,479
Yes.

1072
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,484
Time has not passed for you.
ls that really you?

1073
01:35:39,526 --> 01:35:40,610
Your brother!

1074
01:35:40,652 --> 01:35:42,404
Half-brother.

1075
01:35:45,157 --> 01:35:46,408
I've found you!

1076
01:35:48,160 --> 01:35:49,786
I've found him!

1077
01:35:49,870 --> 01:35:51,663
I've found him!

1078
01:35:59,171 --> 01:36:01,173
Where have you been all this time?

1079
01:36:03,258 --> 01:36:04,551
Why did you just disappear?

1080
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:09,306
I looked for you all over.
I had the fever.

1081
01:36:09,389 --> 01:36:10,807
Ah, you had the fever?

1082
01:36:11,641 --> 01:36:12,684
Liar.

1083
01:36:23,695 --> 01:36:25,030
I'm kidding!

1084
01:36:27,073 --> 01:36:28,325
It's a joke!

1085
01:36:29,576 --> 01:36:30,911
Let's celebrate!

1086
01:36:31,578 --> 01:36:32,662
Let's go.

1087
01:36:35,332 --> 01:36:37,167
Now we're going
to have some fun.

1088
01:36:38,210 --> 01:36:39,336
Come.

1089
01:36:40,712 --> 01:36:42,964
Good morning, Mr. Engineer!

1090
01:36:45,425 --> 01:36:47,344
Now I'll show you the plans.

1091
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:51,598
Who's he?

1092
01:36:52,849 --> 01:36:54,559
He's my lucky charm.

1093
01:36:57,103 --> 01:36:58,438
You know what this is?

1094
01:36:58,605 --> 01:37:00,065
It's the Inviolata.

1095
01:37:00,106 --> 01:37:01,233
Look!

1096
01:37:02,317 --> 01:37:03,360
See?

1097
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,737
Here's the dam

1098
01:37:05,821 --> 01:37:08,198
and here...
the power plant.

1099
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:19,251
Wait here outside.
We have to strike a deal.

1100
01:37:20,377 --> 01:37:21,711
You look after the dog.

1101
01:37:23,088 --> 01:37:24,381
Cigarette...

1102
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:26,591
What are you going to do?

1103
01:37:26,842 --> 01:37:29,386
We ask them for money
and they give it to us.

1104
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:31,012
Monsieur de Luna !

1105
01:37:31,888 --> 01:37:33,348
The cigarette...

1106
01:38:04,921 --> 01:38:06,548
How gullible!

1107
01:38:06,673 --> 01:38:08,425
I'll have you arrested!

1108
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:10,552
You've been wasting my time!

1109
01:38:10,635 --> 01:38:13,263
Always bragging about his properties!

1110
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:15,307
Sure, his properties!

1111
01:38:15,432 --> 01:38:16,808
And you fell for it!

1112
01:38:16,892 --> 01:38:18,810
You lowlife! Fool!

1113
01:38:18,894 --> 01:38:20,687
Draw your weapon, defend me!

1114
01:38:22,689 --> 01:38:24,274
- Are you hurt?
- No.

1115
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,401
He's okay!

1116
01:38:28,904 --> 01:38:31,156
Do you know what you two are'?

1117
01:38:31,698 --> 01:38:33,658
You're a parody.

1118
01:38:38,830 --> 01:38:40,165
Are you alright?

1119
01:38:41,333 --> 01:38:43,835
Yes, yes... of course.

1120
01:39:29,214 --> 01:39:30,757
I'll bring you some coffee?

1121
01:39:46,398 --> 01:39:47,649
Antonia?

1122
01:39:49,150 --> 01:39:50,527
Sir...?

1123
01:39:50,902 --> 01:39:51,987
You.

1124
01:39:52,362 --> 01:39:53,780
He found you...

1125
01:39:59,244 --> 01:40:02,122
Who the hell is this now?

1126
01:40:02,163 --> 01:40:05,667
Not another mouth to feed!

1127
01:40:06,501 --> 01:40:08,294
Who's this neanderthal?

1128
01:40:09,379 --> 01:40:10,672
Who are you?

1129
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,800
- Who are you?!
- Me? Look...

1130
01:40:13,883 --> 01:40:16,052
I'm the one in the portrait.

1131
01:40:20,140 --> 01:40:21,182
That one?

1132
01:40:22,684 --> 01:40:23,935
That's me.

1133
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:26,062
I dunno, we found it...

1134
01:40:26,187 --> 01:40:27,313
Hey. Pippa!

1135
01:40:27,397 --> 01:40:29,315
We found it...

1136
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:31,568
Know where...

1137
01:40:32,277 --> 01:40:33,319
The picture...

1138
01:40:33,903 --> 01:40:35,780
It was in a rubbish dump.

1139
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:37,323
You wanna buy it?

1140
01:41:09,606 --> 01:41:10,732
Who's he?

1141
01:41:11,107 --> 01:41:12,484
No one, mum...

1142
01:41:13,109 --> 01:41:14,694
I'll tell you later.

1143
01:41:19,741 --> 01:41:21,701
Can I? ls this a party?

1144
01:41:21,868 --> 01:41:23,453
Stefania, at last!

1145
01:41:25,121 --> 01:41:27,082
Pippo, what the hell...

1146
01:41:29,000 --> 01:41:30,627
Stop it!

1147
01:41:30,835 --> 01:41:32,337
Give that to me.

1148
01:41:33,004 --> 01:41:34,255
That?

1149
01:41:34,756 --> 01:41:36,216
We found it.

1150
01:41:40,136 --> 01:41:41,763
A little moon...

1151
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,552
They're answering.

1152
01:42:50,957 --> 01:42:52,584
Stefania, come home!

1153
01:42:53,668 --> 01:42:55,336
Come home!

1154
01:43:01,217 --> 01:43:03,428
Come home, I said!

1155
01:43:04,179 --> 01:43:05,722
No, mum, I wanna stay here.

1156
01:43:05,847 --> 01:43:08,600
Dear hosts, I'll be going on my way.

1157
01:43:08,725 --> 01:43:10,602
I deal with you at home!

1158
01:43:12,353 --> 01:43:14,731
It's late, and I should be on my way.

1159
01:43:15,064 --> 01:43:19,110
But you're cordially invited
to lunch tomorrow on my estate...

1160
01:43:19,194 --> 01:43:20,987
To lunch? We'd love to!

1161
01:43:22,322 --> 01:43:24,240
No... there's no need.

1162
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:25,742
No, I insist!

1163
01:43:25,867 --> 01:43:28,745
Let me leave you my business card.

1164
01:43:35,335 --> 01:43:37,128
Well, I'll write my address here.

1165
01:43:41,758 --> 01:43:42,842
Right,

1166
01:43:42,884 --> 01:43:44,594
what time do you eat?

1167
01:43:47,263 --> 01:43:48,765
At one o'clock?

1168
01:43:49,390 --> 01:43:50,600
Half past one?

1169
01:43:51,392 --> 01:43:52,769
Punctuality please.

1170
01:43:54,771 --> 01:43:56,022
Ercole...

1171
01:43:56,606 --> 01:44:00,026
Could I just ask you, please,
to put some effort into your attire?

1172
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:01,903
My lady will be present.

1173
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:03,738
No need tiaras and pearls

1174
01:44:03,780 --> 01:44:06,991
but... it's an official invitation
to a respectable house.

1175
01:44:08,785 --> 01:44:09,911
Chevalier...

1176
01:44:20,421 --> 01:44:21,547
Beautiful!

1177
01:44:21,673 --> 01:44:23,049
Very nice.

1178
01:44:23,174 --> 01:44:24,926
- Perfect.
- What about me?

1179
01:44:25,009 --> 01:44:26,803
Handsome!

1180
01:44:30,056 --> 01:44:31,933
This is an important occasion.

1181
01:44:33,184 --> 01:44:35,019
You need to comb your hair.

1182
01:44:39,399 --> 01:44:41,818
See how good he looks
with his hair combed?

1183
01:44:41,901 --> 01:44:42,944
Yes!

1184
01:44:43,319 --> 01:44:44,904
You look like a prince.

1185
01:44:45,196 --> 01:44:46,447
We ready?

1186
01:44:47,323 --> 01:44:48,324
Let's go.

1187
01:44:49,450 --> 01:44:50,827
But what we bring them?

1188
01:44:51,786 --> 01:44:53,913
We can't turn up empty-handed.

1189
01:44:53,955 --> 01:44:56,332
It's rude to not bring something.

1190
01:44:56,791 --> 01:44:58,543
What do you want to bring?

1191
01:44:58,835 --> 01:45:00,962
They're aristocrats,
they've got everything.

1192
01:45:01,212 --> 01:45:02,839
We should bring pastries.

1193
01:45:03,214 --> 01:45:04,590
Profiteroles, doughnuts...

1194
01:45:04,716 --> 01:45:05,842
Are you kidding?!

1195
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,844
Cupcakes.

1196
01:45:08,094 --> 01:45:10,054
All pastries are good!

1197
01:45:10,096 --> 01:45:12,098
Profiteroles with chocolate, cream.

1198
01:45:12,223 --> 01:45:14,058
Nougat...

1199
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:15,852
Cream pies...

1200
01:45:16,227 --> 01:45:18,313
Eclairs with fresh cream.

1201
01:45:18,730 --> 01:45:20,106
Where are we gonna find pastries?

1202
01:45:20,189 --> 01:45:21,733
We'll go to the cake shop.

1203
01:45:21,858 --> 01:45:23,318
We'll buy them.

1204
01:45:23,818 --> 01:45:26,988
Get the best stuff,
these folks are used to the best.

1205
01:45:42,128 --> 01:45:43,504
- Good morning.
- You are welcome.

1206
01:45:52,597 --> 01:45:54,223
Two of those with the cream.

1207
01:45:54,265 --> 01:45:55,641
Three.

1208
01:45:56,476 --> 01:45:59,145
- What are these ones called?
- These ones with the fruit...

1209
01:45:59,270 --> 01:46:00,646
We'll take five.

1210
01:46:00,730 --> 01:46:02,899
- TiramisÃ¹...
- Four marzipan toadstools.

1211
01:46:02,982 --> 01:46:04,776
- The profiteroles too.
- Cannoli.

1212
01:46:04,901 --> 01:46:06,027
Slowly...

1213
01:46:06,110 --> 01:46:08,029
Those chocolate ones... ten!

1214
01:46:08,112 --> 01:46:10,907
- These ones with crumble...
- No, no... That's enough!

1215
01:46:12,283 --> 01:46:13,659
Arum baba...

1216
01:46:13,785 --> 01:46:15,411
For once...

1217
01:46:21,125 --> 01:46:24,420
That's 81 euros 46 cents.
Call it 81.

1218
01:46:25,296 --> 01:46:27,924
81? What is this, a jeweller's?

1219
01:46:28,925 --> 01:46:31,427
The prices are displayed, sir.

1220
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:36,933
This is all we've got... fifty euros!

1221
01:46:37,058 --> 01:46:39,018
Come on, Antonia, 50 euros...

1222
01:46:39,143 --> 01:46:40,770
I know what I'm doing.

1223
01:46:41,813 --> 01:46:44,065
What are you doing, dancing?

1224
01:47:12,343 --> 01:47:13,970
Number 3, this is it.

1225
01:47:16,597 --> 01:47:17,723
Let's go.

1226
01:47:17,849 --> 01:47:19,100
Hold on.

1227
01:47:19,725 --> 01:47:20,977
What time is it?

1228
01:47:22,353 --> 01:47:23,980
24 minutes past one.

1229
01:47:24,063 --> 01:47:26,441
Wait, we're early.

1230
01:47:26,482 --> 01:47:28,443
Yes, he said half past one.

1231
01:47:31,988 --> 01:47:33,990
I was expecting better.

1232
01:47:35,616 --> 01:47:37,326
They should re-do the plasterwork.

1233
01:47:37,368 --> 01:47:40,246
- Now... What time is it?
- Still 24.

1234
01:47:41,205 --> 01:47:42,331
Careful.

1235
01:47:47,753 --> 01:47:49,005
The Marquise!

1236
01:48:02,393 --> 01:48:03,769
"De Luna"!

1237
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:06,606
They're here!

1238
01:48:24,415 --> 01:48:25,500
Yes?

1239
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:27,418
What do you want?

1240
01:48:27,502 --> 01:48:29,170
We're the guests!

1241
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:30,755
Guests?

1242
01:48:31,380 --> 01:48:33,549
We don't want to buy anything,
thank you.

1243
01:48:33,633 --> 01:48:35,301
Teresa?

1244
01:48:41,641 --> 01:48:44,060
Teresa, don't you recognise me?

1245
01:48:44,143 --> 01:48:46,062
I'm Antonia, from Inviolata.

1246
01:48:47,897 --> 01:48:49,440
No, I'm sorry.

1247
01:48:51,567 --> 01:48:53,819
Who invited you? Him?

1248
01:48:54,153 --> 01:48:55,821
Yes, for lunch.

1249
01:48:55,905 --> 01:48:57,532
At half past one.

1250
01:48:57,949 --> 01:49:00,034
"On the dot", he said.

1251
01:49:00,785 --> 01:49:01,827
Ah...

1252
01:49:01,911 --> 01:49:03,412
Wait here a second,

1253
01:49:03,454 --> 01:49:04,914
I'll be right back.

1254
01:49:08,417 --> 01:49:09,794
Leave me alone!

1255
01:49:15,967 --> 01:49:18,094
There must be some kind of mix-up...

1256
01:49:18,219 --> 01:49:20,972
a mistake.
He didn't invite you here.

1257
01:49:26,811 --> 01:49:28,229
Scoundrel!

1258
01:49:28,604 --> 01:49:30,231
Help me down the stairs.

1259
01:49:37,071 --> 01:49:39,699
He invited us once in a lifetime
and he forgot.

1260
01:49:42,368 --> 01:49:44,120
Nice guy that Marquis, eh?

1261
01:49:49,625 --> 01:49:50,960
Excuse me...

1262
01:49:51,002 --> 01:49:52,086
Stop!

1263
01:49:52,253 --> 01:49:54,255
Could you come here a second?

1264
01:49:55,256 --> 01:49:56,632
It was just a joke!

1265
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:58,884
Come on!

1266
01:49:59,260 --> 01:50:00,386
Let's go!

1267
01:50:06,017 --> 01:50:07,226
Excuse me...

1268
01:50:09,020 --> 01:50:10,980
I wanted to ask you something.

1269
01:50:11,772 --> 01:50:12,898
A little favour.

1270
01:50:13,107 --> 01:50:14,150
What?

1271
01:50:14,400 --> 01:50:17,278
I don't really know how to start...

1272
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:18,738
Just start.

1273
01:50:19,405 --> 01:50:22,283
You know, things are tough for us...

1274
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:23,909
Actually, tragic.

1275
01:50:25,911 --> 01:50:28,122
I saw you were carrying a tray.

1276
01:50:29,248 --> 01:50:30,666
What's in it?

1277
01:50:30,791 --> 01:50:32,168
Pastries!

1278
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:35,004
Right, pastries...

1279
01:50:38,049 --> 01:50:39,383
Tasty.

1280
01:50:39,425 --> 01:50:43,054
- Very tasty.
- We brought the best.

1281
01:50:45,264 --> 01:50:47,391
I recognised the wrapping paper.

1282
01:50:51,437 --> 01:50:53,272
Maybe you could leave them?

1283
01:50:53,314 --> 01:50:56,817
- They're expensive.
- Of course we'll leave them for you.

1284
01:50:58,194 --> 01:50:59,570
Of course.

1285
01:51:02,948 --> 01:51:05,534
Thank you a lot.

1286
01:51:06,035 --> 01:51:07,453
Goodbye.

1287
01:51:07,703 --> 01:51:09,955
How did you get reduced to this state?

1288
01:51:12,333 --> 01:51:13,834
You really want to know?

1289
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:15,586
Of course, tell us.

1290
01:51:15,711 --> 01:51:17,338
You really want to know?

1291
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:19,298
It was the bank!

1292
01:51:19,674 --> 01:51:20,966
It is a Monster!

1293
01:51:21,467 --> 01:51:23,344
It took away everything we had.

1294
01:51:23,469 --> 01:51:25,346
- Everything!
- Well done!

1295
01:51:25,429 --> 01:51:27,473
And now we're left with nothing.

1296
01:51:27,556 --> 01:51:28,849
The bank.

1297
01:51:28,933 --> 01:51:30,726
A bunch of swindlers!

1298
01:51:31,727 --> 01:51:33,104
The Great Swindle!

1299
01:51:33,229 --> 01:51:35,564
No, Lazzaro. The Great Swindle!

1300
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,941
It's what the Marquise

1301
01:51:36,982 --> 01:51:39,568
didn't tell us to keep us in the dark.

1302
01:51:41,195 --> 01:51:42,697
Everyone took advantage of us!

1303
01:51:42,738 --> 01:51:44,490
Keep cool!

1304
01:51:45,241 --> 01:51:46,951
Take it easy!

1305
01:52:03,008 --> 01:52:05,386
You traitor!

1306
01:52:05,886 --> 01:52:07,012
It's dead,

1307
01:52:07,138 --> 01:52:08,639
it won't start.

1308
01:52:12,893 --> 01:52:14,228
Like it?

1309
01:52:16,147 --> 01:52:18,274
You want to go and listen?

1310
01:52:18,399 --> 01:52:19,400
Yes.

1311
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,402
Let's go and listen.

1312
01:52:21,527 --> 01:52:22,653
Let's go.

1313
01:52:22,778 --> 01:52:24,280
Come on...

1314
01:52:25,990 --> 01:52:27,783
- Let's go and listen.
- To what?

1315
01:52:28,784 --> 01:52:31,412
Where are you going? No, no...

1316
01:52:31,537 --> 01:52:32,913
Just five minutes.

1317
01:52:32,997 --> 01:52:34,373
Five minutes.

1318
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:38,043
We need to push start it.

1319
01:52:38,544 --> 01:52:41,046
We need to get home, it's late.

1320
01:52:45,885 --> 01:52:47,178
Nice...

1321
01:53:09,283 --> 01:53:14,705
You can't stay here, you have to go.

1322
01:53:14,789 --> 01:53:17,958
This is a private function,
please leave.

1323
01:53:18,042 --> 01:53:20,544
We just wanted to hear the music
for a bit!

1324
01:53:20,586 --> 01:53:23,714
There'll be another occasion.
Next time. Please go.

1325
01:53:23,839 --> 01:53:25,341
We're not bothering anyone.

1326
01:53:25,466 --> 01:53:28,219
You can't stay.

1327
01:53:28,344 --> 01:53:31,847
- We're not bothering anyone.
- Next time.

1328
01:53:42,691 --> 01:53:44,068
You too.

1329
01:53:46,237 --> 01:53:47,738
Go on, leave.

1330
01:53:51,617 --> 01:53:53,452
Come on, start again.

1331
01:54:12,471 --> 01:54:13,764
Keep playing-

1332
01:54:38,497 --> 01:54:39,874
What's going on?

1333
01:54:43,669 --> 01:54:45,421
It's leaving.

1334
01:54:45,504 --> 01:54:47,423
The music's leaving.

1335
01:54:47,548 --> 01:54:49,425
Close the door!

1336
01:55:03,188 --> 01:55:04,440
Break time.

1337
01:55:07,401 --> 01:55:10,446
If we stop every ten metres,
we'll never get there.

1338
01:55:14,575 --> 01:55:16,201
Hear that?

1339
01:55:16,285 --> 01:55:17,328
What?

1340
01:55:18,454 --> 01:55:19,580
The music.

1341
01:55:19,705 --> 01:55:21,206
Where's it coming from?

1342
01:55:21,290 --> 01:55:22,791
The music!

1343
01:55:22,833 --> 01:55:24,460
It's following us.

1344
01:55:25,044 --> 01:55:26,712
All over the sky?

1345
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:41,101
Listen to that music...

1346
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:42,353
Come on!

1347
01:55:48,233 --> 01:55:51,111
Listen, do you remember Inviolata?

1348
01:55:51,195 --> 01:55:52,988
No, I was too small.

1349
01:55:58,494 --> 01:56:01,121
...If Inviolata is abandoned now,

1350
01:56:01,205 --> 01:56:03,832
why don't we go back there?
We take it over!

1351
01:56:03,958 --> 01:56:05,751
We even have the keys.

1352
01:56:06,627 --> 01:56:08,629
We can't, it's not ours.

1353
01:56:09,129 --> 01:56:14,009
You always complain you built it,
with your work, with your sweat?

1354
01:56:14,093 --> 01:56:17,388
We can squat it!
No bosses, though.

1355
01:56:17,513 --> 01:56:19,139
Without a boss?

1356
01:56:19,264 --> 01:56:20,265
Break time!

1357
01:56:20,391 --> 01:56:21,517
That would be wonderful!

1358
01:56:22,476 --> 01:56:24,853
This music has softened your heads.

1359
01:56:26,397 --> 01:56:29,400
Come on!
What are you doing there?

1360
01:56:29,858 --> 01:56:31,151
Come on!

1361
01:56:32,528 --> 01:56:33,612
Come!

1362
01:56:34,530 --> 01:56:35,906
Leave him be.

1363
01:56:36,532 --> 01:56:38,534
It was a blow for him...

1364
01:56:39,368 --> 01:56:40,536
Let's go.

1365
01:56:40,661 --> 01:56:41,912
Let's go!

1366
01:56:45,290 --> 01:56:46,917
He'll follow us, you'll see.

1367
01:56:53,382 --> 01:56:55,634
You want to go back to the Inviolata?

1368
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:57,636
Of course. Aren't you glad?

1369
01:56:59,013 --> 01:57:01,056
He want to go back to countryside

1370
01:57:01,140 --> 01:57:03,267
to dig the earth...

1371
01:58:18,759 --> 01:58:21,261
Empty your pockets...

1372
01:58:22,346 --> 01:58:25,474
Don't worry, I'll open up.
Go to the other door.

1373
01:58:30,604 --> 01:58:33,398
I'm sorry, this always happens.

1374
01:58:33,524 --> 01:58:34,775
It's broken again.

1375
01:58:34,900 --> 01:58:36,401
I'm sorry.

1376
01:58:39,863 --> 01:58:41,782
I'm sorry, sometimes

1377
01:58:41,907 --> 01:58:44,743
just some loose change can set it off...

1378
01:58:45,786 --> 01:58:49,123
Excuse me,
I need an identity document...

1379
01:58:49,164 --> 01:58:50,916
Get a number...

1380
01:58:51,917 --> 01:58:53,127
We're queuing...

1381
01:58:53,293 --> 01:58:56,171
Sorry, you have to get a number,
there's a queue.

1382
01:58:58,632 --> 01:58:59,675
Sorry?

1383
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,176
What did you say?

1384
01:59:01,927 --> 01:59:05,180
I just said that sometimes
the door gets blocked for nothing.

1385
01:59:05,264 --> 01:59:07,558
Some loose change, keys...

1386
01:59:08,058 --> 01:59:09,935
Do you have something in your pocket'?

1387
01:59:10,185 --> 01:59:11,186
Yes.

1388
01:59:11,311 --> 01:59:13,897
- Do you have something in your pocket'?
- Yes.

1389
01:59:14,439 --> 01:59:15,566
HE'S got a gun!

1390
01:59:15,649 --> 01:59:16,900
I saw him!

1391
01:59:17,693 --> 01:59:18,944
In the back pocket!

1392
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:21,572
Do you have a weapon?

1393
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,074
Yes.

1394
01:59:45,721 --> 01:59:47,598
There's no need for this, sir.

1395
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:50,225
Just keep calm.

1396
01:59:51,977 --> 01:59:53,979
We don't have anything here.

1397
01:59:54,938 --> 01:59:57,232
The vaults are automatic, and we...

1398
01:59:58,108 --> 02:00:01,236
can't open them anymore.

1399
02:00:06,325 --> 02:00:08,202
Can we do anything for you?

1400
02:00:08,452 --> 02:00:10,120
What is it you want?

1401
02:00:12,623 --> 02:00:14,875
If you would be so kind

1402
02:00:14,958 --> 02:00:16,877
as to give back to Tancredi...

1403
02:00:18,128 --> 02:00:19,630
the Marquis De Luna...

1404
02:00:20,631 --> 02:00:22,883
everything that belongs
to the Marquis De Luna.

1405
02:00:27,262 --> 02:00:29,014
Yes.

1406
02:00:30,140 --> 02:00:31,225
We can do that.

1407
02:00:31,266 --> 02:00:33,852
Can you repeat the gentleman's name?

1408
02:00:33,894 --> 02:00:36,897
It's... Marquis Tancredi De Luna,

1409
02:00:38,273 --> 02:00:39,775
he's the boss of Inviolata.

1410
02:00:40,734 --> 02:00:42,277
I'll just check to see

1411
02:00:42,361 --> 02:00:44,154
if he's one of our clients.

1412
02:01:08,553 --> 02:01:09,930
Bastard!

1413
02:01:10,055 --> 02:01:11,515
How dare you?

1414
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:15,310
Go crawl back into your hole!

1415
02:01:15,435 --> 02:01:16,687
You piece of shit!

1416
02:01:20,565 --> 02:01:22,317
Coming here scaring people!

1417
02:01:28,573 --> 02:01:30,575
I've got four children,

1418
02:01:30,701 --> 02:01:32,661
but I don't go around robbing people.

1419
02:01:32,703 --> 02:01:34,079
Thug!

1420
02:01:35,080 --> 02:01:38,083
Look... he wanted to shoot us
with a catapult.

1421
02:01:38,292 --> 02:01:39,418
Thief.

1422
02:01:44,089 --> 02:01:45,340
Stop it!

1423
02:01:45,465 --> 02:01:46,717
Stop it!

1424
02:01:53,724 --> 02:01:57,060
Please, everyone, calm down... calm!

1425
02:01:57,102 --> 02:01:58,478
Calm! Step away!

1426
02:01:58,562 --> 02:01:59,938
You'll kill him!

1427
02:02:00,305 --> 02:02:06,640
