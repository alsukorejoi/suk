00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:11,310
Let's get started.

3
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,646
Drive safely.

4
00:01:20,087 --> 00:01:21,552
Hello, James.

5
00:01:21,554 --> 00:01:24,923
You have one new ride request.

6
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:26,825
Hello.

7
00:01:26,827 --> 00:01:29,429
Ride accepted.
Let's ride.

8
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,007
As the sun goes down

9
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:44,376
and the lights come up
on Los Angeles,

10
00:01:44,378 --> 00:01:47,011
you begin to hear
the true voices of the city.

11
00:01:47,013 --> 00:01:51,049
It's 10:06 p.m.,
and this is the Voice of L.A.

12
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:07,498
In 300 feet, make
a right turn onto Vine Street.

13
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,967
Today what we'll be discussing

14
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,503
is the "big break"
and whether an actor

15
00:02:11,505 --> 00:02:13,604
can have multiple big breaks,
just one,

16
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:14,740
and is there a time
in our career

17
00:02:14,742 --> 00:02:16,508
where we can miss our shot,

18
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,446
which that big break
is never gonna come again.

19
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:31,625
In 300 feet,
make a left turn.

20
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,872
In 300 feet, make a right turn
onto Franklin Avenue.

21
00:02:53,012 --> 00:02:55,680
You have arrived.

22
00:02:55,682 --> 00:02:58,049
And thank you
for tuning in with us tonight.

23
00:02:58,051 --> 00:03:00,855
Stay warm out there, L.A.

24
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,866
Hey, Jessica?

25
00:03:12,832 --> 00:03:14,999
- Yeah, that's me.
- I'm your ride.

26
00:03:15,001 --> 00:03:16,470
Cool.

27
00:03:19,906 --> 00:03:22,944
- James.
- Nice to meet you.

28
00:03:24,577 --> 00:03:26,777
All right.

29
00:03:26,779 --> 00:03:28,580
Where to?

30
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,586
♪ Just when I thought
I'd seen it all ♪

31
00:03:32,586 --> 00:03:36,757
♪ You came along to rescue me ♪

34
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,935
Hey, do you want a water
or some gum?

35
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,770
Do they always
make you say that?

36
00:03:51,772 --> 00:03:53,938
They do.

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,808
But in your case, uh,
I mean it.

38
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:00,748
Uh, no. Thank you.
I'm okay.

39
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:06,016
How long you been
riding with us?

40
00:04:06,018 --> 00:04:08,118
About six months.

41
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,489
I use it a lot between,
you know, not wanting to park

42
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:12,723
and wanting a couple drinks.

43
00:04:12,725 --> 00:04:14,225
Yeah, that's cool.

44
00:04:14,227 --> 00:04:17,062
I'm not, like, deeply passionate
about it or anything,

45
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:19,898
but it's nice to think that,
you know, because of what I do,

46
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,665
there's less drunk drivers
out there.

47
00:04:21,667 --> 00:04:23,834
Not that that would be you
or anything.

48
00:04:23,836 --> 00:04:26,538
Well, I mean,
everybody in L.A. drives drunk.

49
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,973
Oh, come on, not everybody.

50
00:04:27,975 --> 00:04:29,143
Think about it.

51
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,975
Try and name
at least person you know

52
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,881
that hasn't made a mistake once.

53
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:37,915
- Mm.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

54
00:04:37,917 --> 00:04:39,050
See what I'm saying?

55
00:04:39,052 --> 00:04:40,886
- I do. I get you.
- Yeah.

56
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:42,521
In 300 feet,

57
00:04:42,523 --> 00:04:45,624
make a left turn
onto La Cienega Boulevard.

58
00:04:45,626 --> 00:04:48,627
- Oh, uh, take Fountain.
- Oh.

59
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:50,795
Recalculating.

60
00:04:50,797 --> 00:04:52,129
Mae West fan?

61
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,665
Uh, what... what do you mean?

62
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:57,067
Well, there's this
great Mae West interview.

63
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:58,737
Uh, I think it was
Johnny Carson or something.

64
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,204
Whoever it was said,

65
00:05:00,206 --> 00:05:02,173
"What's the fastest way
to get into Hollywood?"

66
00:05:02,175 --> 00:05:03,675
to which she replied...

67
00:05:03,677 --> 00:05:05,709
"Take Fountain."

68
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:09,617
That's cool.
I like that.

69
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:18,689
♪ Just when I thought
I'd seen it all ♪

70
00:05:18,691 --> 00:05:21,192
Um, I, uh, I like your suit,
by the way.

71
00:05:21,194 --> 00:05:22,726
What, do you, like, uh,

72
00:05:22,728 --> 00:05:24,963
moonlight as a limo driver
or something?

73
00:05:24,965 --> 00:05:26,665
I wish.

74
00:05:26,667 --> 00:05:28,699
It was, uh, for this thing
that I had before this.

75
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:30,201
A wedding?

76
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:31,670
An audition.

77
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:33,805
Oh, so you're an actor.

78
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,906
Mm-hmm.
Unfortunately, yeah.

79
00:05:35,908 --> 00:05:38,576
God, I could never be an actor.

80
00:05:38,578 --> 00:05:40,678
I just...
I can't take the rejection.

81
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,112
See, I just had to realize

82
00:05:42,114 --> 00:05:45,050
that getting turned down
isn't a failure.

83
00:05:45,052 --> 00:05:47,117
Not getting auditions,
that's failure.

84
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:48,752
So you get a lot, then?

85
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:51,822
Uh, my agents have gotten better
at sending me out.

86
00:05:51,824 --> 00:05:52,923
Oh, you're repped?

87
00:05:52,925 --> 00:05:54,158
- Mm-hmm.
- By who?

88
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,795
- Uh, Abrams.
- Mm, you fancy, huh?

89
00:05:57,797 --> 00:05:59,930
Abrams.

90
00:05:59,932 --> 00:06:01,766
They're pretty good.
I'm not... They're pretty good.

91
00:06:01,768 --> 00:06:04,603
There was a dry spell, though,
like six months of nothing.

92
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,737
- That sucks.
- Yeah, it was rough.

93
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:09,143
But, um, then they kind of
sent me out on this thing.

94
00:06:09,145 --> 00:06:11,108
I think it was, like,
the last Hail Mary pass.

95
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,045
Inches from getting dropped,
but I booked it.

96
00:06:14,047 --> 00:06:15,146
Oh, what?
Congrats!

97
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:16,747
- Thanks.
- That's so cool.

98
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,182
What, uh... What is it?

99
00:06:18,184 --> 00:06:19,850
Uh, it's no big deal.

100
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:21,952
It's, like, a guest spot
on "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

101
00:06:21,954 --> 00:06:25,023
No big deal?
That's a huge fucking deal.

102
00:06:25,025 --> 00:06:27,225
Congrats!
That's so cool.

103
00:06:27,227 --> 00:06:28,860
Thanks.
It's a henchman.

104
00:06:28,862 --> 00:06:31,730
You know, couple lines,
and I took someone's gun.

105
00:06:31,732 --> 00:06:33,964
But still, so cool.

106
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:36,668
I did start going out a lot more
because of it, so...

107
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:40,105
In 300 feet, make a right turn
onto Fountain Avenue.

108
00:06:40,107 --> 00:06:43,641
Um, you should, uh,
let me know when it airs.

109
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:46,978
My roommate, Allie,
is a huge Marvel fan,

110
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,879
and she's just
gonna freak her shit

111
00:06:48,881 --> 00:06:51,649
when I tell her that my driver's
on "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

112
00:06:51,651 --> 00:06:53,317
as a cool villain.

113
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:54,819
Well, I was... I was a henchman.

114
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:57,055
I haven't graduated
to villain yet.

115
00:06:57,057 --> 00:07:00,927
Well, I believe in you.

116
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,336
Continue for three-quarters
of a mile.

117
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,011
Your destination will be
on the right.

118
00:07:18,444 --> 00:07:19,910
Here we are.

119
00:07:19,912 --> 00:07:21,245
That was fast.

120
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:23,113
Hey, when in doubt,
take Fountain.

121
00:07:23,115 --> 00:07:24,449
Yeah, exactly.

122
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,084
You have reached
your destination.

123
00:07:26,086 --> 00:07:28,655
We hope you had
a safe and pleasant ride.

124
00:07:29,823 --> 00:07:33,692
Hey, can I, uh,
tip you or something?

125
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,326
We're not allowed
to accept tips.

126
00:07:35,328 --> 00:07:37,095
Uh, the app takes care
of everything.

127
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,430
Right. Well, uh...

128
00:07:39,432 --> 00:07:41,766
I'll be sure to give you
a five-star rating, then.

129
00:07:41,768 --> 00:07:43,367
Right back at you.

130
00:07:43,369 --> 00:07:46,271
Wait, the... the drivers
rate the passengers?

131
00:07:46,273 --> 00:07:47,471
Yeah, sure.

132
00:07:47,473 --> 00:07:50,975
Oh, okay.
So what's my rating, then?

133
00:07:50,977 --> 00:07:53,110
I wouldn't worry about it
if I were you.

134
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:54,946
Oh, okay.

135
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,247
I'm not gonna leave this car

136
00:07:56,249 --> 00:07:57,917
until you tell me
what my rating is.

137
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:02,220
- It's 3.5. But it...
- Fucking seriously?

138
00:08:02,222 --> 00:08:05,389
- But it doesn't mean anything.
- 3.5? People hate me.

139
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:07,091
- I wouldn't worry about it.
- Oh, my God.

140
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:08,860
It doesn't mean anything,
you know?

141
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,295
Well, how do I...
how do I turn this shit around?

142
00:08:11,297 --> 00:08:13,732
Look, you're a five-star
passenger in my book.

143
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:15,165
And that's all that matters,
right?

144
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:18,004
- That's all that matters.
- Mm.

145
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:24,278
Well, uh, thank you
for the ride, James.

146
00:08:25,145 --> 00:08:26,814
Anytime.

147
00:08:37,857 --> 00:08:40,991
Oh, uh, you forget something?

148
00:08:40,993 --> 00:08:42,826
So my friends and I

149
00:08:42,828 --> 00:08:44,863
were just grabbing
a couple drinks here.

150
00:08:44,865 --> 00:08:46,197
Very, you know, low-key,

151
00:08:46,199 --> 00:08:49,033
if you want to come in
for a round.

152
00:08:49,035 --> 00:08:53,104
Hello, James.
You have one new ride request.

153
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:57,041
I wish.
But I got to drive.

154
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,208
- Boo.
- I know.

155
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:00,477
Okay, well, suit yourself,
but, uh,

156
00:09:00,479 --> 00:09:01,980
we'll be here
for a couple hours,

157
00:09:01,982 --> 00:09:06,049
so if you pick up
a big fare, swing by.

158
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:08,485
I'd love that.
Yeah.

159
00:09:08,487 --> 00:09:10,424
Okay. Bye.

160
00:09:18,265 --> 00:09:19,864
"Oh, hey,
what's your phone number?

161
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,032
Oh, no, here's my phone number."

162
00:09:21,034 --> 00:09:23,003
Fucking idiot.

163
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:26,471
Ride accepted.
Let's ride.

164
00:09:31,444 --> 00:09:36,483
Continue on Sunset Boulevard
for three-quarters of a mile.

165
00:09:39,051 --> 00:09:40,854
Turn left.

166
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:54,268
Continue on
Gower Street for one mile.

167
00:09:57,469 --> 00:09:59,239
Ride canceled.

168
00:10:06,979 --> 00:10:09,013
Loneliness is
an emotional state

169
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:11,081
that we have when
we're feeling disconnected.

170
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,951
It can cause depression,

171
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:15,286
and it can even lead
to premature death.

172
00:10:15,288 --> 00:10:16,955
Oh, wow.

173
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,489
We're spending less time
making meaningful...

174
00:10:18,491 --> 00:10:21,024
This is the Voice of L.A.

175
00:10:21,026 --> 00:10:23,260
The time now is 10:45 p.m.

176
00:10:23,262 --> 00:10:28,298
Hello, James.
You have one new ride request.

177
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,403
So your parents went with Bruno?

178
00:10:34,207 --> 00:10:36,607
At least people
seem to like you.

179
00:10:36,609 --> 00:10:39,379
Ride accepted.
Let's ride.

180
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,557
You have arrived.

181
00:10:54,593 --> 00:10:56,530
Uh, hey!

182
00:10:58,899 --> 00:11:01,068
- What's up?
- Are you Bruno?

183
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:10,110
Who wants to know?

184
00:11:11,077 --> 00:11:12,376
Oh, fuck.

185
00:11:12,378 --> 00:11:14,144
You're my ride.
Of course.

186
00:11:14,146 --> 00:11:16,547
Uh, sorry, man. I didn't think
you'd get here so soon.

187
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:19,350
Look, shit got a little messy.
Start the meter.

188
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:23,023
Well, that's... that's not how
this works.

189
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:35,600
Yo, you're looking sharp, bro.

190
00:11:35,602 --> 00:11:37,567
Is that like
a uniform or something?

191
00:11:37,569 --> 00:11:40,104
Something like that.

192
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,639
Oh, hey, man.
Uh, can't smoke in my car.

193
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:45,375
Fuck me.
So sorry, brother.

194
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:48,078
Uh, I'm gonna finish this guy
if that's all right with you.

195
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,346
You can start the meter.
I don't give a shit.

196
00:11:49,348 --> 00:11:51,381
That's actually
not how it works.

197
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:52,582
Oh, well, fuck it.

198
00:11:52,584 --> 00:11:54,085
I'll throw
some extra cash your way,

199
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:55,119
make it worth your while.

200
00:11:55,121 --> 00:11:56,321
Can't accept tips, bro.

201
00:11:56,323 --> 00:11:57,721
The app takes care
of everything.

202
00:11:57,723 --> 00:12:00,524
I won't tell anyone
if you don't.

203
00:12:00,526 --> 00:12:02,159
The thing is,
this is a New York pack

204
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:04,262
so the cigs are really
fucking expensive.

205
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:06,397
I know you're thinking I could
get the same goddamn cigs here

206
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,698
for half the goddamn price,

207
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,467
but I don't know
what to tell you.

208
00:12:10,469 --> 00:12:12,302
I'm a sentimental guy.

209
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:13,504
You want one?

210
00:12:13,506 --> 00:12:15,273
Uh, I'm good, man.
Thanks.

211
00:12:15,275 --> 00:12:17,741
James, please enter
a destination.

212
00:12:17,743 --> 00:12:21,412
Yo, aren't you gonna offer me,
like, a... a water or something?

213
00:12:21,414 --> 00:12:24,014
- Some gum?
- What?

214
00:12:24,016 --> 00:12:27,719
That's what you guys
usually do, isn't it?

215
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:31,292
Yeah.

216
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,225
Yo, you want a water?

217
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:37,595
No. No, not right now.
I'm good, man.

218
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:39,464
Thanks. Maybe later.

219
00:12:39,466 --> 00:12:41,398
Hey, where we going, man?

220
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,434
Straight to business.
I can respect that.

221
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:51,045
LAX? Burbank?

222
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:53,677
Don't tell me
I got to go to Long Beach.

223
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,681
Yo, what the fuck
are you talking about, man?

224
00:12:56,683 --> 00:12:59,783
Airports.
It's your bag.

225
00:12:59,785 --> 00:13:01,385
Oh. Gotcha.

226
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:04,721
No, no, no.
That's a messy breakup.

227
00:13:04,723 --> 00:13:06,591
I'm actually not sure
where I want to go right now.

228
00:13:06,593 --> 00:13:10,794
I just needed
to get away from her.

229
00:13:10,796 --> 00:13:14,599
I'm sorry to hear that, man.
Breakups are awful.

230
00:13:15,668 --> 00:13:18,036
I love you.

231
00:13:18,038 --> 00:13:21,408
I... I know.

232
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:24,509
Yeah.

233
00:13:24,511 --> 00:13:26,679
Yeah, brother, they really are.

234
00:13:30,116 --> 00:13:31,749
All right, Bruno.

235
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:33,087
Where we headed?

236
00:13:34,353 --> 00:13:36,086
Your name's James, right?

237
00:13:36,088 --> 00:13:37,554
I mean, that's what
the thing said.

238
00:13:37,556 --> 00:13:39,090
Yeah. That's right.

239
00:13:39,092 --> 00:13:41,259
Ask me again.

240
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:42,527
Ask what again?

241
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,629
"Where to, Bruno?"

242
00:13:44,631 --> 00:13:47,398
All right.
Where to?

243
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,067
Home, James,
and don't spare the horses!

244
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:55,072
Sorry.

245
00:13:55,074 --> 00:13:56,640
I couldn't resist.

246
00:13:56,642 --> 00:13:58,643
I'm sure you get that
all the time.

247
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:03,114
To be honest, uh, you're the
first to make the connection.

248
00:14:03,116 --> 00:14:07,487
Oh. It is kind of my specialty,
making connections.

249
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:12,255
I could really go for some of
that gum if you've got any.

250
00:14:12,257 --> 00:14:15,028
- What?
- That gum you mentioned earlier.

251
00:14:22,334 --> 00:14:24,668
James, please enter
a destination.

252
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,238
All right, Bruno.
Where you want to go?

253
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,505
Look, I don't want to
put you out,

254
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,142
but would you mind taking me

255
00:14:30,144 --> 00:14:32,243
to a couple of different
places tonight?

256
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,711
It'll be a big fare for you,

257
00:14:33,713 --> 00:14:35,446
and I'll throw some extra cash
on top.

258
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:37,414
Look, man,
I'm sorry about this,

259
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:40,884
but I just don't have
a long ride in me tonight.

260
00:14:40,886 --> 00:14:43,221
And like I said,
I can't accept tips.

261
00:14:43,223 --> 00:14:45,755
And like I said,
I won't tell if you don't.

262
00:14:45,757 --> 00:14:47,424
That's nice and everything,

263
00:14:47,426 --> 00:14:49,860
but I kind of got somewhere
I need to be in an hour.

264
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:51,696
- In an hour?
- Yeah.

265
00:14:51,698 --> 00:14:54,898
My man, you couldn't have made
it to LAX to save your life.

266
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,833
Come on, you give me
a couple hours,

267
00:14:56,835 --> 00:15:03,807
and I will throw $100
on top of the fare.

268
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,344
You need like a minute
to think about that?

269
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:08,379
And the best
thing about public radio

270
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:09,514
is there are no commercials.

271
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:10,715
- That'll work.
- All right.

272
00:15:10,717 --> 00:15:12,482
Let's get fucking rolling.

273
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:15,519
Now, first,
I am feeling majorly down,

274
00:15:15,521 --> 00:15:17,388
so I'm gonna need
a massive pick-me-up.

275
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,222
Do you know this place Eidobon?

276
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:21,158
That's "nobodie"
spelled backwards.

277
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,528
- I'm not sure.
- It's the spot off Larchmont.

278
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:26,297
It's on Beverly and Beachwood,
south side.

279
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,532
All right.

280
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:31,201
They do this
fucking coffee there.

281
00:15:31,203 --> 00:15:32,802
It's fucking incredible.

282
00:15:32,804 --> 00:15:34,404
- Wait, wait.
- It was started by this guy...

283
00:15:34,406 --> 00:15:35,706
You want coffee right now?

284
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:37,374
Yeah.
Only way to go is up.

285
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:39,677
Do you have, like,
a piece of paper for this gum?

286
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:42,346
Sure.

287
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,351
Here.

288
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:48,451
Anyway, so this coffee

289
00:15:48,453 --> 00:15:50,187
was started
by this guy with this website.

290
00:15:50,189 --> 00:15:51,956
And he was hiking
in the Himalayas,

291
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,924
and he was on the brink
of exhaustion,

292
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:56,793
and he met these monks,
and the monks gave him this tea.

293
00:15:56,795 --> 00:15:59,964
And guess what was in the tea.
Yak butter.

294
00:15:59,966 --> 00:16:03,668
Fucking butter
from fucking yaks.

295
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,369
So he gets back to the States

296
00:16:05,371 --> 00:16:07,638
and tries all kinds of shit
to replicate it.

297
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:12,610
And after months of failure,
guess what the key was.

298
00:16:12,612 --> 00:16:15,346
- What was it?
- Grass.

299
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:19,350
It had to be grass-fed butter.

300
00:16:19,352 --> 00:16:21,719
This stuff is ambrosia, bro.

301
00:16:21,721 --> 00:16:23,854
Dude made millions
or some shit.

302
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:26,323
- That's cool.
- You want one? I'll get you one.

303
00:16:26,325 --> 00:16:28,592
Nah, man. I don't... I don't
really drink coffee this late.

304
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:29,994
Why?
It makes you feel weird?

305
00:16:29,996 --> 00:16:31,528
Do you know why?
Toxins.

306
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,697
Most coffee is full of toxins

307
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:35,666
because the beans
are covered in mold.

308
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:39,570
But this coffee is lab tested.
They take all the toxins out.

309
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,304
- Mm.
- Right?

310
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,773
Okay, well, we're here.

311
00:16:42,775 --> 00:16:46,344
Um, okay, cool. Let me finish.
Where was I?

312
00:16:46,346 --> 00:16:47,644
They take all the toxins out,

313
00:16:47,646 --> 00:16:49,913
and then they brew it
as a pour-over,

314
00:16:49,915 --> 00:16:51,615
which then they mix it
with the grass-fed butter

315
00:16:51,617 --> 00:16:53,918
and this special
fortified coconut oil.

316
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,885
Dude, if done properly,

317
00:16:55,887 --> 00:16:59,256
I defy any fucking barista
to make a creamier

318
00:16:59,258 --> 00:17:00,924
or more delicious cup of coffee

319
00:17:00,926 --> 00:17:02,759
than the one I am
about to buy you.

320
00:17:02,761 --> 00:17:04,795
You down?

321
00:17:04,797 --> 00:17:06,596
Dude, you down?

322
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:08,566
Sure, man, I'm down.

323
00:17:08,568 --> 00:17:10,737
Great.
I'll be right back, my brother.

324
00:17:33,026 --> 00:17:35,826
This, is, uh,
seriously yak butter?

325
00:17:35,828 --> 00:17:37,297
You like it?

326
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,365
- I actually do.
- Fuck yeah.

327
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:43,904
Just wait till you see
how it makes you feel, my man.

328
00:17:55,348 --> 00:17:57,480
Please enter a destination.

329
00:17:57,482 --> 00:17:58,982
Yo, is there a way
to shut that thing up?

330
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:01,618
It's just gonna keep saying
that every 15 minutes.

331
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,354
Well, that fucking sucks.

332
00:18:03,356 --> 00:18:07,325
All right, Bruno,
where are we headed?

333
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:08,959
I want to see if I can crash

334
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:11,494
with a buddy
at Wilshire and Westlake.

335
00:18:11,496 --> 00:18:13,364
Okay, well, I'm gonna
be honest with you.

336
00:18:13,366 --> 00:18:15,098
I have no idea where that is.

337
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,599
Dude, shouldn't you know
this city

338
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:17,903
like the back
of your fucking hand?

339
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:22,506
- I can Maps it.
- I'm fucking with you.

340
00:18:22,508 --> 00:18:24,508
East on Wilshire
past MacArthur Park.

341
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:25,910
I'll be your Sherpa.

342
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:28,045
MacArthur Park.
Isn't that a little sketchy?

343
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,448
What can I say?
I hang out with sketchy people.

344
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:34,085
You're tuned in
to 81.3, the Voice of L.A.

345
00:18:34,087 --> 00:18:37,387
- All right.
- So, dude, what's your story?

346
00:18:37,389 --> 00:18:39,856
I mean, what do you do?

347
00:18:39,858 --> 00:18:42,460
I drive for Ryde.

348
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:45,395
No, that's what you're doing.
Nobody wants to do that.

349
00:18:45,397 --> 00:18:47,932
- Thanks.
- Don't pretend you're offended.

350
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:50,567
People don't get offended
by the truth.

351
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:51,836
You gonna sit there
and lie to me,

352
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:53,674
or are you gonna
tell me who you are?

353
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,444
I'm an actor, man.

354
00:19:00,113 --> 00:19:01,912
Fuck, that's so L.A.

355
00:19:01,914 --> 00:19:04,147
Of course you're an actor.

356
00:19:04,149 --> 00:19:06,683
Jesus, that's awful.

357
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,986
No, no, no. No.
Don't take it like that.

358
00:19:08,988 --> 00:19:10,820
I'm sure you're amazing.

359
00:19:10,822 --> 00:19:16,126
I'm just saying this world,
you know, we take our artists,

360
00:19:16,128 --> 00:19:18,464
and we make them drive our cars.

361
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,867
Stage or screen?

362
00:19:23,001 --> 00:19:25,836
Yo, you just told me you want to
perform for a living.

363
00:19:25,838 --> 00:19:27,404
Don't clam up now.

364
00:19:27,406 --> 00:19:29,673
Well, I went to school
for theater,

365
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:33,411
but I'm here auditioning for TV.

366
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:36,480
Commercials. Whatever.

367
00:19:36,482 --> 00:19:39,583
You're a thespian.
Master thespian.

368
00:19:40,853 --> 00:19:42,787
You got any monologues
you can reel off?

369
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:44,922
- Come on, man.
- I'm not fucking with you.

370
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:46,990
I legitimately love theater.

371
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:50,461
And there's never anything
good out here.

372
00:19:50,463 --> 00:19:53,431
- You know Shakespeare?
- I might've heard of him.

373
00:19:53,433 --> 00:19:55,465
- Do a monologue.
- No.

374
00:19:55,467 --> 00:19:57,902
Dude, do a monologue.

375
00:19:57,904 --> 00:19:59,636
I am not about to reel off

376
00:19:59,638 --> 00:20:01,605
a Shakespearean monologue
right now.

377
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:03,641
Okay.

378
00:20:03,643 --> 00:20:07,010
That's okay.
I can respect that.

379
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:09,078
- 50 bucks.
- What?

380
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,048
I am going to pay you
an extra $50

381
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:14,453
to do a monologue
from Shakespeare.

382
00:20:16,489 --> 00:20:17,855
A hundred.

383
00:20:17,857 --> 00:20:19,623
Do not fuck with me right now.

384
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,692
Dead serious.
A hundred bucks.

385
00:20:21,694 --> 00:20:23,126
Think of it as a favor to me.

386
00:20:23,128 --> 00:20:25,729
And do "Richard III."
It's my favorite.

387
00:20:25,731 --> 00:20:27,798
Well, I don't know
"Richard III."

388
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,732
Okay.

389
00:20:29,734 --> 00:20:31,067
I know "Richard II."

390
00:20:31,069 --> 00:20:33,103
Fuck yeah!
Now we're fucking talking.

391
00:20:33,105 --> 00:20:36,610
- Let's hear that shit!
- Ah!

392
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:47,218
Huh.

393
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:50,019
Let's talk of graves,

394
00:20:50,021 --> 00:20:53,156
of worms and epitaphs,

395
00:20:53,158 --> 00:20:57,760
make dust our paper
and with rainy eyes write sorrow

396
00:20:57,762 --> 00:20:59,663
on the bosom of the earth.

397
00:20:59,665 --> 00:21:04,201
Let's choose executors,
talk of wills,

398
00:21:04,203 --> 00:21:06,936
and yet not so,
for what can we bequeath

399
00:21:06,938 --> 00:21:09,874
save our deposed bodies
to the ground?

400
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:14,744
Our land, our lives,
and all are Bolingbroke's,

401
00:21:14,746 --> 00:21:17,714
and nothing can we call our own
but death.

402
00:21:17,716 --> 00:21:20,917
For God's sake,
let us sit upon the ground

403
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:23,520
and tell sad stories
of the death of kings.

404
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:26,155
For within the hollow crown
that rounds

405
00:21:26,157 --> 00:21:30,027
the mortal temples of a king
keeps Death his court,

406
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:34,030
infusing him with self
and vain conceit,

407
00:21:34,032 --> 00:21:38,067
as if this flesh
which walls about our life

408
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:40,170
were brass impregnable,

409
00:21:40,172 --> 00:21:44,240
and humored thus
comes at the last

410
00:21:44,242 --> 00:21:50,748
with a little pin bore through
his castle walls, farewell king.

411
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,919
Cover your heads
and mock not flesh and blood

412
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:56,720
with solemn reverence...

413
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:59,923
throw away respect
and tradition,

414
00:21:59,925 --> 00:22:03,794
form, ceremonious duty,

415
00:22:03,796 --> 00:22:07,298
for you have but mistook me
all this while...

416
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,200
I live with bread like you,

417
00:22:10,202 --> 00:22:14,038
feel want, taste grief,

418
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:19,676
need friends,
and subjected thus,

419
00:22:19,678 --> 00:22:22,248
how can you say to me,
I am a king?

420
00:22:30,021 --> 00:22:31,689
You are a king.

421
00:22:31,691 --> 00:22:34,057
You're the fucking king, man.

422
00:22:34,059 --> 00:22:37,994
Oh, you should be booking all
over the place with that shit.

423
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:39,963
It's money well spent.

424
00:22:39,965 --> 00:22:42,732
Wow.

425
00:22:42,734 --> 00:22:44,768
I don't know what to say, man.
You liked it?

426
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,202
I liked it?

427
00:22:46,204 --> 00:22:48,806
You're an artist.

428
00:22:48,808 --> 00:22:50,807
That shit comes from the heart.

429
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:53,810
That means a whole lot
to hear you say that, man.

430
00:22:53,812 --> 00:22:55,613
That one's
kind of close to me.

431
00:22:55,615 --> 00:22:57,914
Like, I used it
to audition for school.

432
00:22:57,916 --> 00:23:00,084
This is gonna sound dumb,
but when I think about

433
00:23:00,086 --> 00:23:02,251
like what it is that
I really want out of life,

434
00:23:02,253 --> 00:23:06,957
I just, I don't want to die
having not played Richard II.

435
00:23:06,959 --> 00:23:09,226
- Broadway?
- Any stage will do.

436
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:14,163
Okay, I hate to be that asshole
who asks,

437
00:23:14,165 --> 00:23:16,700
"Have I seen you in anything?"
but...

438
00:23:16,702 --> 00:23:18,769
But would I have
seen you in anything?

439
00:23:18,771 --> 00:23:21,771
Uh, well,

440
00:23:21,773 --> 00:23:25,976
I did this, uh, guest spot
on "Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."

441
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,112
- No fucking way.
- Yeah.

442
00:23:28,114 --> 00:23:29,413
I bet you were
the supervillain.

443
00:23:29,415 --> 00:23:31,981
No.
I was a henchman.

444
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:35,419
I haven't graduated
to supervillain yet.

445
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:38,058
Well, we'll get you there,
buddy.

446
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:48,865
All right,
halfway up the block.

447
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:51,000
Okay, just pull up right here.

448
00:23:51,002 --> 00:23:53,836
All right, here.

449
00:23:53,838 --> 00:23:56,973
Uh, flashers off. Just chill.
I'll be like two minutes.

450
00:23:56,975 --> 00:24:00,076
You mind killing the lights,
leaving the engine on?

451
00:24:00,078 --> 00:24:01,811
Okay.
Is everything all right?

452
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:04,248
Totally. It's just
a sketchy neighborhood.

453
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:06,182
I get nervous.

454
00:24:06,184 --> 00:24:08,786
So you want me to just, like,
just wait here for a second?

455
00:24:08,788 --> 00:24:10,688
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I just need to see

456
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,388
if my buddy's home
and if I can crash with him.

457
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,191
If not, I might need to roll
somewhere else.

458
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:15,962
You mind waiting?
Is that cool?

459
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:20,963
- Yeah, man. It's cool.
- Thank God.

460
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:23,032
What are the chances
I could ever find another James?

461
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:24,233
Slim to none.

462
00:24:24,235 --> 00:24:26,336
Slim to none.
I hate those odds.

463
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:28,707
- Thanks, dude.
- All right, man.

464
00:24:43,455 --> 00:24:45,288
Hello?

465
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:46,990
Hey, man.

466
00:24:46,992 --> 00:24:49,759
No, I'm... I'm good.
I'm all good.

467
00:24:49,761 --> 00:24:54,230
Yeah. I'm sure
it's pretty late for you.

468
00:24:54,232 --> 00:24:55,965
It has been a while.

469
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:59,970
Uh, I'm... I'm driving for Ryde.
Yeah.

470
00:24:59,972 --> 00:25:01,505
Hey, listen, I actually wanted
to ask you something.

471
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:04,907
Hey, hang on
for a second, Jason.

472
00:25:12,851 --> 00:25:15,184
Yeah, I'm here.
My bad.

473
00:25:15,186 --> 00:25:18,154
Um, yeah, when you were...
when you were driving,

474
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:21,759
did anybody ever ask you out?

475
00:25:21,761 --> 00:25:24,994
Yeah, like a girl, man.

476
00:25:28,166 --> 00:25:32,836
Yeah, she was beautiful,
and we just... we hit it off.

477
00:25:32,838 --> 00:25:35,471
Well, I guess I wouldn't
be asking about it,

478
00:25:35,473 --> 00:25:38,008
but I... I guess
I'm still thinking about her.

479
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,277
Shit.

480
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:43,079
Uh, yeah, well, let me...
let me call you back actually.

481
00:25:43,081 --> 00:25:44,948
Nah, don't worry about it.

482
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,016
Oh.

483
00:25:46,018 --> 00:25:47,416
Uh, yeah.

484
00:25:47,418 --> 00:25:49,553
All right.
Talk to you soon. Bye.

485
00:25:49,555 --> 00:25:51,555
All right, let's get
the fuck out of dodge.

486
00:25:51,557 --> 00:25:53,760
All right.
Let's do it.

487
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:57,326
Can you please do that
from the road?

488
00:25:57,328 --> 00:26:00,300
- Uh, sure.
- Trying to make moves.

489
00:26:01,267 --> 00:26:03,299
No problem.

490
00:26:06,238 --> 00:26:10,374
Up next, a local band
with a vintage sound.

491
00:26:10,376 --> 00:26:12,009
These guys
have been taking over...

492
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:15,479
So what's up, man?
Was your buddy not home or what?

493
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:18,917
Uh, yeah, he wasn't...
he wasn't there.

494
00:26:20,051 --> 00:26:22,286
Park's beautiful
this time of night.

495
00:26:22,288 --> 00:26:26,123
No, I mean, it's filled
with homeless drug addicts,

496
00:26:26,125 --> 00:26:27,958
but it's beautiful nonetheless.

497
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:31,528
Where are we headed?

498
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:35,535
Uh, just keep heading west.
I'll figure it out.

499
00:26:37,536 --> 00:26:39,873
Yo, you know you've got
something on your shirt?

500
00:26:40,606 --> 00:26:42,405
Oh, shit.

501
00:26:42,407 --> 00:26:45,342
Ah, I used to get these
fucking nosebleeds as a kid,

502
00:26:45,344 --> 00:26:47,477
and the cold weather
brings them back.

503
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:50,079
- Here, you want a tissue?
- No, I'm good, I'm good.

504
00:26:50,081 --> 00:26:51,882
- You sure?
- Yeah.

505
00:26:51,884 --> 00:26:52,952
All right.

506
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,287
Yo, Bruno,
when we were back there,

507
00:26:57,289 --> 00:26:59,189
did you hear something weird?

508
00:26:59,191 --> 00:27:02,259
Pff, dude, it's MacArthur Park.

509
00:27:02,261 --> 00:27:05,628
Neighborhood is nothing but
weird noises.

510
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,932
- I'm from out here actually.
- Where? From MacArthur Park?

511
00:27:08,934 --> 00:27:11,634
No. I'm a L.A. native, though.
There are fewer and fewer of us.

512
00:27:11,636 --> 00:27:15,873
We're a dying breed.
Like unicorns or some shit.

513
00:27:18,309 --> 00:27:21,310
Hey, uh, I want to apologize
for earlier,

514
00:27:21,312 --> 00:27:22,346
making you miss your thing.

515
00:27:22,348 --> 00:27:24,280
- What thing?
- Thing.

516
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:26,415
The thing you had to do
an hour after you picked me up.

517
00:27:26,417 --> 00:27:28,085
Oh! It's funny.

518
00:27:28,087 --> 00:27:31,320
Nah, I'd forgotten
all about that.

519
00:27:31,322 --> 00:27:34,924
Well sincerely, thank you
for missing it, whatever it was.

520
00:27:34,926 --> 00:27:36,195
No problem.

521
00:27:38,396 --> 00:27:40,029
What was it?

522
00:27:40,031 --> 00:27:43,133
- Ah, it wasn't important.
- Oh, shit.

523
00:27:43,135 --> 00:27:45,571
That means it definitely
was important. What was it?

524
00:27:47,106 --> 00:27:48,404
Just this girl.

525
00:27:48,406 --> 00:27:51,307
- Fuck me! Just this girl?
- Oh, don't do that.

526
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:53,343
- There are no three words...
- Come on.

527
00:27:53,345 --> 00:27:56,078
...in the contemporary
English language more telling,

528
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:00,517
more loaded, more fucking epic
in scope than "just this girl."

529
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:03,086
Fucking take that,
William Shakespeare!

530
00:28:03,088 --> 00:28:06,323
Yo, it's... it's really not
that big of a deal, bro.

531
00:28:06,325 --> 00:28:08,357
Give me the details. I'll tell
you if it was a big deal.

532
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:11,929
All right,
so before I picked you up,

533
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:13,230
like, I had my first fare
of the night,

534
00:28:13,232 --> 00:28:14,263
and it was this girl.

535
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:15,632
Oh, this girl.

536
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:18,669
So, like, I prepare myself
for the usual,

537
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,703
you know, try to turn
the awkward conversation

538
00:28:20,705 --> 00:28:22,239
into witty banter.

539
00:28:22,241 --> 00:28:24,641
But this time
it's a little different.

540
00:28:24,643 --> 00:28:27,144
- You got a picture.
- What?

541
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:29,512
- On the app, man.
- No, that's creeping, bro.

542
00:28:29,514 --> 00:28:31,248
- That's unethical.
- What are you talking about?

543
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:33,482
What's unethical
is to get me this interested

544
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:35,384
and not let me know
what she looks like.

545
00:28:35,386 --> 00:28:37,354
"Previous fare."

546
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:39,556
Yo.

547
00:28:39,558 --> 00:28:40,958
- What the fuck, dude?
- See that?

548
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,425
I know, right?
Look.

549
00:28:42,427 --> 00:28:45,328
All right, man, that's enough.

550
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:49,566
Anyway, so, like, I really liked
talking to this girl.

551
00:28:49,568 --> 00:28:52,234
You know what I mean?
She was just no bullshit.

552
00:28:52,236 --> 00:28:53,569
Like, she even made this joke

553
00:28:53,571 --> 00:28:56,405
about how everyone in L.A.
drives drunk.

554
00:28:56,407 --> 00:28:58,008
Uh, she's not wrong.

555
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:00,544
Well, yeah, but anyways,
at the end of the ride,

556
00:29:00,546 --> 00:29:02,511
she invites me
to come meet up with her

557
00:29:02,513 --> 00:29:04,513
and her friends for some drinks.

558
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:07,651
Oh, man, that's the dream, dude.

559
00:29:07,653 --> 00:29:10,420
Cabbie gets asked out
by a hot passenger.

560
00:29:10,422 --> 00:29:12,756
- Jesus Christ.
- Yeah, man.

561
00:29:12,758 --> 00:29:15,124
Yeah.

562
00:29:15,126 --> 00:29:17,126
Then what the fuck
are you doing here with me?

563
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:21,030
Well, uh, I needed
to make some money.

564
00:29:21,032 --> 00:29:24,201
Yo, tell me
you got her number.

565
00:29:24,203 --> 00:29:26,269
Ohh...

566
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:28,538
She got away, like,
right before I could.

567
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,008
Oh, bullshit.
You hesitated.

568
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,410
I did not hesitate.

569
00:29:35,313 --> 00:29:36,982
I hesitated.

570
00:29:38,317 --> 00:29:39,682
Let's go.

571
00:29:39,684 --> 00:29:41,484
Where to next, man?

572
00:29:41,486 --> 00:29:44,421
- The bar, man.
- What do you mean, the bar?

573
00:29:44,423 --> 00:29:46,222
The bar where the girl said
she was gonna be.

574
00:29:46,224 --> 00:29:47,758
- Where was it?
- No! We don't need to do that.

575
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,126
Dude, you caught feelings.
We got to go!

576
00:29:50,128 --> 00:29:52,328
No, it was like
this little passing moment...

577
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:54,397
James, I am not gonna be
the force in your life

578
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,366
that prevents you from hanging
out with this girl tonight.

579
00:29:57,368 --> 00:29:59,435
I mean, who knows, man,
maybe you're meant...

580
00:29:59,437 --> 00:30:02,138
meant to kiss her tonight.

581
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:05,241
Maybe you're meant
to fuck her tonight.

582
00:30:05,243 --> 00:30:07,109
Maybe you're meant
to knock this girl up,

583
00:30:07,111 --> 00:30:09,278
and nine months from now
you marry her

584
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,614
to appease her parents,

585
00:30:10,616 --> 00:30:13,316
and I'm the best man
at your fucking wedding.

586
00:30:13,318 --> 00:30:18,188
Wow. Uh, I'm gonna pass
on that last part.

587
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,524
All right,
well, I'm offended by that.

588
00:30:20,526 --> 00:30:23,059
But this girl is gonna be
more offended

589
00:30:23,061 --> 00:30:24,326
if you don't show up tonight.

590
00:30:24,328 --> 00:30:25,595
She's counting on you.

591
00:30:25,597 --> 00:30:28,330
Bro, she could not have
actually thought

592
00:30:28,332 --> 00:30:30,200
- that I was gonna come.
- Are you kidding?

593
00:30:30,202 --> 00:30:31,667
What world do you live in

594
00:30:31,669 --> 00:30:33,702
where a girl
invites a guy somewhere

595
00:30:33,704 --> 00:30:35,538
she doesn't actually
want him to be?

596
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:37,740
That does not happen.

597
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:41,310
Right now she is in there
making a conversation,

598
00:30:41,312 --> 00:30:43,413
faking a fucking laugh
here and there.

599
00:30:43,415 --> 00:30:44,815
"Ha ha! Ha ha. Ha."

600
00:30:44,817 --> 00:30:48,285
But all the while
she's glancing back at the door.

601
00:30:48,287 --> 00:30:50,820
And in the back of her mind,
she's waiting for someone...

602
00:30:50,822 --> 00:30:52,588
- Come on, bro.
- ...to walk through that door.

603
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,157
That someone is you, homey.

604
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:57,227
That someone is you!

605
00:30:57,229 --> 00:31:01,397
Up next is a song
to make some mistakes to.

606
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:05,669
♪ Feel a change
coming over me ♪

607
00:31:05,671 --> 00:31:09,372
♪ It's a brand-new day ♪

608
00:31:09,374 --> 00:31:12,808
♪ I can clearly see ♪

609
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,113
♪ And the morning
when I wake up ♪

610
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:18,647
♪ Till I sleep at night ♪

611
00:31:18,649 --> 00:31:21,250
Oh, we're too late.
Look... Look at this line.

612
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:23,252
Just tell them
you're with Bruno Anthony.

613
00:31:23,254 --> 00:31:25,255
You're kidding.

614
00:31:25,257 --> 00:31:28,325
Dude, trust me.
All right, here's the plan.

615
00:31:28,327 --> 00:31:30,393
You run in, walk straight
up to her, no hesitation.

616
00:31:30,395 --> 00:31:33,529
You say a polite hello to her
friends and then ignore them.

617
00:31:33,531 --> 00:31:37,634
And then, very directly,
you ask her if she wants to come

618
00:31:37,636 --> 00:31:40,871
with you and a buddy... me...
to a house party in Malibu.

619
00:31:40,873 --> 00:31:44,907
A little kickback, a few brews,
a fucking hot tub.

620
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:46,276
She'll never go for that.

621
00:31:46,278 --> 00:31:48,878
Tell her that sometimes

622
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,748
when we trust our impulses,

623
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:54,384
incredible things can happen.

624
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:56,353
I'm a total stranger.

625
00:31:56,355 --> 00:32:01,527
Well, a stranger is just
a friend you haven't met yet.

626
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:07,797
We're going to a hot tub
in Malibu?

627
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:09,766
You are goddamn right we are.

628
00:32:09,768 --> 00:32:11,771
Now get in there and bring back
a beautiful woman.

629
00:32:15,507 --> 00:32:18,275
- It's a tow-away zone.
- Just leave the keys with me.

630
00:32:18,277 --> 00:32:19,675
What do you think, I'm crazy?

631
00:32:19,677 --> 00:32:21,577
Dude, I couldn't do anything
if I wanted to.

632
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:25,350
The app has my card number.
It'd charge me for a car.

633
00:32:27,685 --> 00:32:28,785
Okay, here's a bet.

634
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:30,753
If you can pull this off,

635
00:32:30,755 --> 00:32:33,557
I'll be your chauffeur
for the rest of the night.

636
00:32:36,761 --> 00:32:37,961
Done.

637
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:40,497
All right.

638
00:32:40,499 --> 00:32:42,598
You want me to see if she has
like a hot friend or something?

639
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:46,204
Absolutely not.
This night is about you.

640
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:25,909
I don't know if you saw,

641
00:33:25,911 --> 00:33:27,844
but there's a little bit
of a line.

642
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,679
Uh, I'm meeting Bruno Anthony.

643
00:33:29,681 --> 00:33:31,548
Why didn't you say so?
Go ahead.

644
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,519
And tell him I say hi.

645
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:18,627
Hi! Wow!
You finally came.

646
00:34:18,629 --> 00:34:20,763
I did not think
you were gonna show.

647
00:34:20,765 --> 00:34:23,368
Oh, it's been
a super bizarre night.

648
00:34:36,647 --> 00:34:39,415
- You want a drink?
- I'm actually still working.

649
00:34:39,417 --> 00:34:41,817
Oh.
Then why'd you come?

650
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:44,423
I really liked talking to you.

651
00:34:45,723 --> 00:34:50,396
Uh, I really liked
talking to you too.

652
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,500
I mean, the last thing I want

653
00:34:57,502 --> 00:34:59,502
is to be one of those
smarmy Ryde guys

654
00:34:59,504 --> 00:35:00,803
who, like, manages
to get a number.

655
00:35:00,805 --> 00:35:03,740
No, no, I don't think
you're smarmy.

656
00:35:03,742 --> 00:35:06,375
So I made
a good first impression.

657
00:35:06,377 --> 00:35:08,814
Mm.

658
00:35:10,948 --> 00:35:14,551
Hello, James.
Please enter a destination.

659
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:18,087
So I made a buddy tonight.

660
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:20,622
He invited me
to this party in Malibu

661
00:35:20,624 --> 00:35:23,727
with some drinks,
a little music.

662
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:25,895
- Apparently there's a hot tub.
- Ooh.

663
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:27,767
And I want you to come.

664
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,303
A buddy?

665
00:35:36,107 --> 00:35:37,674
Yeah, his girl left him,

666
00:35:37,676 --> 00:35:39,542
and he's kind of
piecing things back together,

667
00:35:39,544 --> 00:35:40,642
but he seems chill.

668
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,712
Um...

669
00:35:42,714 --> 00:35:44,848
I thought it might be
a little weird,

670
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:46,415
me coming back here
to see you,

671
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,852
but sometimes when you trust
your impulses,

672
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:50,656
incredible things can happen.

673
00:35:51,722 --> 00:35:54,723
So where did you say
that party was at, again?

674
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:56,692
We'll be keeping
the vinyl spinning

675
00:35:56,694 --> 00:36:00,098
for quite some time,
so don't touch that dial.

Dude!
Where's your car?

688
00:36:37,568 --> 00:36:39,067
That's not fucking cool, Bruno.

689
00:36:39,069 --> 00:36:40,904
Cops were gonna tow you,
brother. I had to make a call.

690
00:36:40,906 --> 00:36:42,571
That's fucking bullshit, man.

691
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:45,741
Dude, look over there.

692
00:36:45,743 --> 00:36:48,845
- Oh, fuck me.
- A thank-you would be nice.

693
00:36:48,847 --> 00:36:51,113
Hey.
Is this your friend?

694
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,616
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, this is him.

695
00:36:53,618 --> 00:36:56,051
- Hi.
- Hi.

696
00:37:00,658 --> 00:37:03,091
Oh, shit, I love this song.

697
00:37:03,093 --> 00:37:05,194
This is a mix.

698
00:37:05,196 --> 00:37:07,095
James still burns mix CDs.

699
00:37:07,097 --> 00:37:08,865
My phone doesn't connect.

700
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:10,799
That's fucking adorable.

701
00:37:10,801 --> 00:37:12,968
So, uh, for those of us
without an app,

702
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:14,571
what is your name, my dear?

703
00:37:14,573 --> 00:37:16,605
Oh, how rude of me.

704
00:37:16,607 --> 00:37:17,841
- I'm Jess.
- How rude indeed.

705
00:37:17,843 --> 00:37:20,075
Jess.
What a pleasure.

706
00:37:20,077 --> 00:37:23,078
Wow, so fancy and formal.

707
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,781
Nice to meet you, Bruno A.?

708
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:27,183
Bruno A.
That's me.

709
00:37:27,185 --> 00:37:29,519
All the names in the book

710
00:37:29,521 --> 00:37:32,020
your parents
could have went with,

711
00:37:32,022 --> 00:37:33,823
they went with Bruno?

712
00:37:33,825 --> 00:37:36,058
Beg your pardon!
Bruno's a sweet name.

713
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,828
Yo, I'm sorry, man, but I
thought the exact same thing.

714
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:43,066
Oh, backstabber.
True colors, James.

715
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:46,703
Wait, James, why didn't you
tell me your friend was a ride?

716
00:37:46,705 --> 00:37:48,104
Yeah, what the fuck, James?

717
00:37:48,106 --> 00:37:49,805
- What the fuck, James?
- You didn't ask!

718
00:37:49,807 --> 00:37:51,908
Dude, I told you
to lead with that.

719
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,977
- Whatever. It's all equal now.
- What do you mean?

720
00:37:53,979 --> 00:37:57,080
Well, you were a ride,
and now we're all best friends.

721
00:37:57,082 --> 00:38:01,116
Yeah, see, a stranger is just a
friend that you haven't met yet.

722
00:38:01,118 --> 00:38:03,051
Wow, this has got to
win the prize

723
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:05,988
for the most unintentionally
creepy marketing campaign

724
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,890
I have ever heard.

725
00:38:07,892 --> 00:38:09,158
But you're still
gonna use the app.

726
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,660
- Yeah.
- Okay, then.

727
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:13,029
Hey!
Aw, Bruno...

728
00:38:13,031 --> 00:38:14,997
What's up, Jess?
Talk to me, girl.

729
00:38:14,999 --> 00:38:16,698
I don't mean to be that person,

730
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,734
but do you mind
if I have a drag of that?

731
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,102
- Jess.
- Yes?

732
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:22,071
You're a self-loathing smoker.

733
00:38:22,073 --> 00:38:24,207
- Ugh.
- If you want a cig, have a cig.

734
00:38:24,209 --> 00:38:25,741
Just don't apologize for it.

735
00:38:25,743 --> 00:38:27,676
Now these are New York cigs,

736
00:38:27,678 --> 00:38:29,279
so they're basically
worth their weight in gold.

737
00:38:29,281 --> 00:38:30,879
- Yo, Bruno...
- I know what you're thinking.

738
00:38:30,881 --> 00:38:32,314
I could probably just get
the same fucking...

739
00:38:32,316 --> 00:38:34,250
- Bruno.
- What is it, James?

740
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:35,852
Can't smoke in my car.

741
00:38:35,854 --> 00:38:37,553
Yo, I would not dream of it.

742
00:38:37,555 --> 00:38:39,622
I know. You told me before.
I absolutely wouldn't.

743
00:38:39,624 --> 00:38:41,024
Jess is gonna smoke
in your car,

744
00:38:41,026 --> 00:38:42,292
and you're gonna
be cool about it.

745
00:38:42,294 --> 00:38:44,093
No, no, no.
I really didn't mean...

746
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:46,062
Jess, don't worry about it.
We're gonna crack a window.

747
00:38:46,064 --> 00:38:48,031
He's gonna be tight.

748
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:50,633
Yo, look at this.
End of Fountain.

749
00:38:50,635 --> 00:38:52,000
Bette Davis,
you've done us well.

750
00:38:52,002 --> 00:38:54,169
- Oh, boy.
- Ho! Wait a minute.

751
00:38:54,171 --> 00:38:55,571
I think I got you right there,
my man.

752
00:38:55,573 --> 00:38:56,906
Here we go.

753
00:38:56,908 --> 00:38:58,607
That was Mae West that said,
"Take Fountain."

754
00:38:58,609 --> 00:38:59,908
No, no, no.
That's bullshit.

755
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,910
Uh, no, I swear.
That's a Mae West quote.

756
00:39:01,912 --> 00:39:03,779
Yo, you should know this.
You're an actor.

757
00:39:03,781 --> 00:39:06,749
- He told me this story earlier.
- He told it to you wrong.

758
00:39:06,751 --> 00:39:08,817
Honestly, I thought
you were a weirdo.

759
00:39:08,819 --> 00:39:10,587
Oh, really?

760
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:11,921
So weird that you invited me
to the bar.

761
00:39:11,923 --> 00:39:14,591
Why do you think
I invited you to the bar?

762
00:39:14,593 --> 00:39:16,758
Yes, because we're all
beautiful fucking weirdos.

763
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,729
But the point is
it's Bette Davis.

764
00:39:19,731 --> 00:39:21,930
- I'll bet you anything.
- I don't need to fucking bet.

765
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:24,633
If you're so confident,
look it up.

766
00:39:24,635 --> 00:39:25,801
- Should I?
- Please do.

767
00:39:25,803 --> 00:39:27,069
- Yes? Okay!
- Pull out a phone.

768
00:39:27,071 --> 00:39:28,337
- Oh, my gosh.
- We're looking it up.

769
00:39:28,339 --> 00:39:30,173
- The moment of truth.
- Bated breath.

770
00:39:30,175 --> 00:39:32,207
Honestly, James, I don't mean
to offend you, but...

771
00:39:32,209 --> 00:39:33,910
What?

772
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:36,145
Bruno just sounds more
convincing when he says it.

773
00:39:36,147 --> 00:39:38,214
Yeah, liars always do.

774
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,116
It's loading.
Hold on.

775
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:42,151
Tell him.

776
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:44,053
- Sorry, James.
- Oh, suck it, James.

777
00:39:44,055 --> 00:39:45,787
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

778
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,290
"The legend has it that
when the famous Bette Davis

779
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:49,024
was being interviewed
on a talk show,

780
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:50,859
she was asked what advice
she had for actors

781
00:39:50,861 --> 00:39:52,028
trying to make it
in Hollywood.

782
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:54,196
Her response, "Take Fountain,"

783
00:39:54,198 --> 00:39:57,200
according to
akumenang.com

784

No, no, no, no, no.

Oh, thank you so much.

792
00:40:13,718 --> 00:40:15,350
I think music, you know,

793
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,220
is the way that all of us
human beings

794
00:40:17,222 --> 00:40:18,388
were meant
to express ourselves.

795
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,888
Yes!

796
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:21,323
I mean, without a voice,
what have you got?

797
00:40:21,325 --> 00:40:23,660
No, seriously.
I mean, I-I'm a singer.

798
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:27,129
I mean, I'm not, like, a singer.
You know, I sing, but...

799
00:40:27,131 --> 00:40:30,799
Jess, I knew that about you
the moment I met you.

800
00:40:30,801 --> 00:40:32,067
- Really?
- I swear to God.

801
00:40:32,069 --> 00:40:33,803
No way. Aw!

802
00:40:33,805 --> 00:40:36,339
Okay, hey, Bruno, could you
slow down a little bit?

803
00:40:36,341 --> 00:40:38,207
Sure. Watch this!

804
00:40:38,209 --> 00:40:39,941
Whoa!
What the hell, man?

805

What the fuck?

806
00:40:43,682 --> 00:40:45,314
You guys should dance.

What?

808
00:40:46,685 --> 00:40:47,917
- James.
- Here?

809
00:40:47,919 --> 00:40:52,055
Ask her to dance
right here, right now.

810

Oh, come on, it's not like

811

you're gonna look back
at this night and regret

812
00:40:55,959 --> 00:40:57,993
dancing in the middle
of Avenue of the Stars

813

on your first date.

814
00:40:59,229 --> 00:41:04,066
Oh!
Is this our first date, James?

815
00:41:04,068 --> 00:41:06,703
In that case,
you'd better ask me to dance.

816
00:41:06,705 --> 00:41:08,437
I think I'm gonna have to
take down my hair for this.

817
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:10,138
She's taking down her hair,
James.

Yes. You may.

You ready?

Jess, give me your phone.

This is too good.
I got to get it.

833
00:42:01,392 --> 00:42:02,792
It's in the backseat.

834
00:42:02,794 --> 00:42:04,761
Yep.
Wait, Jess.

835
00:42:04,763 --> 00:42:06,928
- Run and jump into my arms.
- What?

836

- No!

Hurry up before we get arrested!

838
00:42:10,033 --> 00:42:11,334
- Come on.
- Nooo!

839
00:42:11,336 --> 00:42:13,205
Go!

840
00:42:16,073 --> 00:42:17,809
Oh, my God.

841
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,243
That wasn't so bad, right?

842
00:42:21,245 --> 00:42:23,212
Hey, if this were a movie,

843
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:24,814
the sprinklers would come on
right now,

844
00:42:24,816 --> 00:42:26,848
and y'all would kiss
in that fake L.A. rain.

845
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:29,484
Get out of here, man.

846
00:42:29,486 --> 00:42:30,886
You want to get a drink?

847
00:42:30,888 --> 00:42:32,988
Oh, I love
where your head's at.

848
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,156
- I know the spot.
- Whoo!

849
00:42:34,158 --> 00:42:35,991
- Right nearby.
- Let's get some alcohol!

850
00:42:35,993 --> 00:42:38,828
Get out of here.

851
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:43,064
- So ready for a drink.
- Oh, man.

852
00:42:43,066 --> 00:42:45,901
Wait, so this is the spot?

853
00:42:45,903 --> 00:42:48,236
Yes, this is the spot, Jess.

854
00:42:48,238 --> 00:42:51,941
Look, uh, bottle's on me,
but I could also use some cash.

855
00:42:51,943 --> 00:42:54,977
James, do you mind
going in for me?

856
00:42:54,979 --> 00:42:57,013
I'd prefer if you did it, bro.

857
00:42:57,015 --> 00:42:59,214
Why? You don't trust me
with your lady?

858
00:42:59,216 --> 00:43:01,417
Oh, "your lady"?

859
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:04,086
One dance,
and I'm already your lady?

860
00:43:04,088 --> 00:43:06,354
- I'm working on it.
- Look, just show them this.

861
00:43:06,356 --> 00:43:08,924
They'll give you
anything you want.

862
00:43:08,926 --> 00:43:12,194
Get some old fucking
blended shit and $500.

863
00:43:12,196 --> 00:43:13,462
Please.

864
00:43:13,464 --> 00:43:15,598
What the fuck, man?

865
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,566
Put that shit away!

866
00:43:17,568 --> 00:43:19,267
Okay, you know what?

867
00:43:19,269 --> 00:43:21,837
If you don't, your new friend
in the back's night

868
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,006
is gonna take
a slight turn for the worse.

869
00:43:24,008 --> 00:43:26,174
Don't point that
fucking thing at her.

870
00:43:26,176 --> 00:43:28,477
Did you ever see
what a .44 Magnum

871
00:43:28,479 --> 00:43:30,412
could do to a woman's face?

872
00:43:30,414 --> 00:43:34,383
It'd fucking destroy it.
Just blow it right apart.

873
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:37,019
That's what I could do
to her face.

874
00:43:37,021 --> 00:43:40,223
Now did you ever see what it
could do to a woman's pussy?

875
00:43:40,225 --> 00:43:42,892
Now, that you should see.

876
00:43:42,894 --> 00:43:45,861
That you should see,
what... what a .44 Magnum

877
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:49,467
is gonna do to a woman's pussy,
you should see.

878
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:57,506
I'm fucking
with you.

879
00:43:57,508 --> 00:44:00,176
It's from "Taxi Driver."

880
00:44:00,178 --> 00:44:01,410
Thank you.

881
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:03,912
Oh, you should've seen
your faces.

882
00:44:05,582 --> 00:44:07,549
Jess, the child locks are on.

883
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,120
Goddamn it.

884
00:44:11,055 --> 00:44:13,189
Bruno, tell me
that that's not real.

885
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:16,328
Dude, take a look.

886
00:44:19,430 --> 00:44:23,131
Now, if you don't want to come
back to a car full of dead girl,

887
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,903
I suggest you get a move on.

888
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:38,980
Whoa-hoa-hoa.

889
00:44:38,982 --> 00:44:41,283
I don't know who you are or what
the fuck you think you're doing,

890
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:43,451
but it's time for you to get
the fuck out of my car!

891
00:44:43,453 --> 00:44:45,154
- Aah!
- James!

892
00:44:45,156 --> 00:44:47,593
Ah! Shit!

893
00:44:49,093 --> 00:44:51,459
- Open your mouth.
- Oh, fuck!

894
00:44:51,461 --> 00:44:53,129
James, if you don't
open your mouth,

895
00:44:53,131 --> 00:44:55,064
I'm gonna shoot you,

896
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:58,203
and then I'm going to shoot her
with the gun still in your hand.

897
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,372
And the next time
you point a gun at someone,

898
00:45:04,374 --> 00:45:07,243
you better be very fucking sure
you can pull the trigger,

899
00:45:07,245 --> 00:45:11,314
because if you hesitate,
somebody's gonna fucking die,

900
00:45:11,316 --> 00:45:13,049
and it's not gonna be
fucking me!

901
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:14,586
Let him go.

902
00:45:15,986 --> 00:45:17,520
He'll do it.

903
00:45:17,522 --> 00:45:19,625
Okay.

904
00:45:23,694 --> 00:45:27,999
I like old blended whiskeys,
and I like $50 bills.

905
00:45:51,356 --> 00:45:53,122
Don't you fucking move!

906
00:45:53,124 --> 00:45:54,660
Hold on. Wait a minute, dude.
You got this all wrong.

907
00:45:56,294 --> 00:45:59,361
It's okay, Jess.
I got your phone.

908
00:45:59,363 --> 00:46:01,596
Can you just
take the car and... and go?

909
00:46:01,598 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm not gonna say anything.
James isn't gonna say either.

910
00:46:04,502 --> 00:46:06,301
Jess, be quiet.
You're missing the movie.

911
00:46:06,303 --> 00:46:08,738
Wait, wait, wait.
I need you to listen, please!

912
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,605
- Put the fucking gun down!
- I need you to call the police!

913
00:46:10,607 --> 00:46:12,544
I'll fucking kill you, man!

914
00:46:13,577 --> 00:46:15,146
Fuck.

915
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:19,415
Uh, how...

916
00:46:19,417 --> 00:46:21,316
It's okay, Jess.
Use your words.

917
00:46:21,318 --> 00:46:23,285
H-How do I know that this isn't

918
00:46:23,287 --> 00:46:26,254
some fucked-up game
that you guys play?

919
00:46:26,256 --> 00:46:28,491
You know, h-how do I know
that James is not in on this?

920
00:46:44,042 --> 00:46:45,540
Fucking...
just fucking say something.

921
00:46:45,542 --> 00:46:47,743
Can you just say something?

922
00:46:47,745 --> 00:46:50,482
I-I need you to talk to me.

923
00:46:52,082 --> 00:46:55,319
You've got to tell me
w-what happened in there.

924
00:46:58,156 --> 00:47:00,122
Wow, am I the only one
who feels like things

925
00:47:00,124 --> 00:47:03,758
just got
a little awkward in here?

926
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,164
I think a drink
would break the ice.

927
00:47:15,606 --> 00:47:17,506
James, would you
do the honors?

928
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:29,618
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.
Ladies first.

929
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,252
I'm good.

930
00:47:31,254 --> 00:47:35,790
Jess, James went
to extraordinary lengths

931
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:38,430
to procure this bottle for you.

932
00:47:42,499 --> 00:47:43,531
Ugh. Come on.

933
00:47:43,533 --> 00:47:44,866
Mm! Mm! Mm!

934
00:47:44,868 --> 00:47:48,205
- All right, enough, enough.
- Mm! Mm.

935
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:50,575
Oh, fuck.

936
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:05,187
There is nothing like
a drink and a smoke.

937
00:48:05,189 --> 00:48:07,156
I remember the first time
I had them both together.

938
00:48:07,158 --> 00:48:08,656
I was 14.

939
00:48:08,658 --> 00:48:11,392
It was an act of defiance
and self-gratification

940
00:48:11,394 --> 00:48:14,263
that just perfectly hit
the person I was

941
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:16,765
and my place in the world.

942
00:48:16,767 --> 00:48:19,801
And it's never been
the fucking same since.

943
00:48:19,803 --> 00:48:21,736
What do you mean?

944
00:48:21,738 --> 00:48:25,409
That nothing's ever as fucking
good as the first time.

945
00:48:28,178 --> 00:48:31,346
James, have you tried this?

946
00:48:31,348 --> 00:48:33,582
Never.

947
00:48:33,584 --> 00:48:34,850
Enjoy it.

948
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:37,153
You never will
quite the sa...

949
00:48:37,155 --> 00:48:40,321
again.

950
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:41,823
Damn.

951
00:48:41,825 --> 00:48:45,493
Not even your shitty
philosophizing can ruin that.

952
00:48:47,397 --> 00:48:48,796
There you go.

953
00:48:48,798 --> 00:48:51,267
One drink, and your
sense of humor is back.

954
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:52,703
You can give up
the buddy shit, Bruno.

955
00:48:54,437 --> 00:48:56,404
I am your buddy, man.

956
00:48:56,406 --> 00:48:57,805
In fact, right now,

957
00:48:57,807 --> 00:49:00,709
I'm your best friend
in the whole world.

958
00:49:00,711 --> 00:49:02,544
James, I'm really cold.

959
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:04,348
Do you mind
if I borrow your jacket?

960
00:49:06,283 --> 00:49:08,252
Ever the gentleman.

961
00:49:11,388 --> 00:49:12,888
I undid
the child locks.

962
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:15,924
Oh, Jess, if you're cold,
we should get going.

963
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:17,926
It's your turn to drive.

964
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:19,962
I'm not driving.

965
00:49:19,964 --> 00:49:21,497
Why not?

966
00:49:21,499 --> 00:49:23,535
I thought everyone in L.A.
drives drunk.

967
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:30,474
Good to know
James has a big mouth.

968
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:33,845
Ugh. James.

969
00:49:40,685 --> 00:49:42,317
Come on, James.

970
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:45,156
You don't want to miss
the end of your own date.

971
00:49:51,261 --> 00:49:52,361
Give me another swig.

972
00:49:52,363 --> 00:49:54,363
- Whoa.
- Are you insane?

973
00:49:54,365 --> 00:49:57,269
And I thought I had
low regard for human life.

974
00:50:06,443 --> 00:50:08,879
Mm!

975
00:50:11,314 --> 00:50:12,814
You got dumped tonight, right?

976
00:50:12,816 --> 00:50:15,783
James, you do have
a big fucking mouth.

977
00:50:15,785 --> 00:50:18,821
Is that why you're doing this?
Because she hurt you?

978
00:50:18,823 --> 00:50:20,355
She hurt your feelings,

979
00:50:20,357 --> 00:50:22,323
and... and now you think
you're gonna relive

980
00:50:22,325 --> 00:50:24,892
your... your old relationship
with James and me

981
00:50:24,894 --> 00:50:26,294
is... is really gonna...

982
00:50:26,296 --> 00:50:28,497
Darling,
your pop-psychology bullshit

983
00:50:28,499 --> 00:50:30,633
is not gonna get you
out of this one.

984
00:50:30,635 --> 00:50:32,537
Please enter a destination.

985
00:50:37,642 --> 00:50:41,776
Look, you've been afforded
an opportunity tonight.

986
00:50:41,778 --> 00:50:45,281
We're conditioned
to do what's expected,

987
00:50:45,283 --> 00:50:48,417
down to following
the GPS instructions

988
00:50:48,419 --> 00:50:50,685
that come out of
our fucking phones.

989
00:50:50,687 --> 00:50:54,923
But tonight,
you get to do otherwise.

990
00:50:54,925 --> 00:50:56,792
I'm sorry.

991
00:50:56,794 --> 00:50:59,861
For what?

992
00:50:59,863 --> 00:51:01,398
For undoing the child locks.

993
00:51:03,901 --> 00:51:06,468
Aah! Fuck!

994
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,002
James, come on!

995
00:51:08,004 --> 00:51:09,904
Run! Run, Jess!

996
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:11,674
James!

997
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:13,841
James!

998
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:16,044
Hold on. Hold on.
I-I... I need you to hold the...

999
00:51:26,557 --> 00:51:28,957
You came back for her.

1000
00:51:28,959 --> 00:51:31,696
Let's see if she shows you
the same courtesy.

1001
00:51:48,111 --> 00:51:49,977
I missed you, Jess.

1002
00:51:49,979 --> 00:51:52,480
You shouldn't have come back.

1003
00:51:52,482 --> 00:51:54,383
We better get Captain America
here to a drugstore

1004
00:51:54,385 --> 00:51:58,890
before he vomits all over
his pleather interior and me.

1005
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:02,057
I'm so sorry, James.

1006
00:52:02,059 --> 00:52:04,392
I dislocated
your shoulder back there,

1007
00:52:04,394 --> 00:52:07,662
so it's gonna hurt like shit
until I pop it back in.

1008
00:52:07,664 --> 00:52:10,031
At which point
it's gonna hurt even worse.

1009
00:52:10,033 --> 00:52:11,533
Is that okay, buddy?

1010
00:52:11,535 --> 00:52:12,667
Leave him alone.

1011
00:52:12,669 --> 00:52:15,837
Fine, you pop it back in.

1012
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:17,740
Jess.

1013
00:52:17,742 --> 00:52:19,741
W-Wh...

1014
00:52:19,743 --> 00:52:21,877
It's okay, James.
Use your words.

1015
00:52:21,879 --> 00:52:23,779
Why would you come back?

1016
00:52:23,781 --> 00:52:25,848
Isn't it obvious?

1017
00:52:25,850 --> 00:52:27,716
'Cause she's a good person,
dawg.

1018
00:52:27,718 --> 00:52:29,817
What's she gonna do,
leave you here with me?

1019
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:31,655
That's cold.

1020
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:36,892
All right, we're gonna need
a few things...

1021
00:52:36,894 --> 00:52:38,894
painkillers, a sling,

1022
00:52:38,896 --> 00:52:41,796
and something wooden
for James to bite down onto.

1023
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:43,634
Here's how we're gonna do this.

1024
00:52:50,673 --> 00:52:53,441
Hi, Bruno.
Hey, it's me... Bruno.

1025
00:52:53,443 --> 00:52:56,113
Bruno, may I speak to Jess,
please?

1026
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,816
It's for you.

1027
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:03,919
Jess,
would you do me a favor?

1028
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:05,787
Would you keep this on speaker?

1029
00:53:05,789 --> 00:53:08,459
And hum something for me
so I know you're there.

1030
00:53:12,763 --> 00:53:14,062
Can you hand me my purse?

1031
00:53:14,064 --> 00:53:16,064
I think it's wedged
between the seats.

1032
00:53:16,066 --> 00:53:18,669
Looks like you've got
some shoplifting to do.

1033
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:21,569
Hop to.

1034
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:24,408
James back here
isn't getting any healthier.

1035
00:53:30,513 --> 00:53:31,979
Oh, and Jess?

1036
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:35,419
If you bring back any help,
I'll kill him.

1037
00:54:09,986 --> 00:54:12,254
Can I help you find
anything tonight, ma'am?

1038
00:54:12,256 --> 00:54:14,591
I...

1039
00:54:18,828 --> 00:54:20,865
Sorry, what are you saying?

1040
00:54:21,865 --> 00:54:23,198
I'm okay, thank you.

1041
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,535
Okay.

1042
00:54:30,874 --> 00:54:34,611
Someone is taking
her sweet time.

1043
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,779
At least she could've done us
the courtesy

1044
00:54:37,781 --> 00:54:39,948
of closing the door.

1045
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:41,953
It's chilly.

1046
00:54:51,729 --> 00:54:53,160
The body of a man

1047
00:54:53,162 --> 00:54:54,997
found in Hollywood
earlier this evening

1048
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:58,600
has been identified
as 31-year-old Bruno Anthony.

1049
00:54:58,602 --> 00:55:01,035
Anthony was
a respected club promoter

1050
00:55:01,037 --> 00:55:03,538
in the Los Angeles
nightlife community.

1051
00:55:03,540 --> 00:55:06,040
Friends are still in shock
at the vicious murder,

1052
00:55:06,042 --> 00:55:08,009
which the LAPD have determined

1053
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:10,578
was the result
of blunt force trauma.

1054
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:13,115
Anthony's body was found
inside the Hollywood apartment

1055
00:55:13,117 --> 00:55:16,051
that he shared with
his fiancée, Gwyneth Cassidy.

1056
00:55:16,053 --> 00:55:19,187
Before his death, Anthony
announced his recent engagement

1057
00:55:19,189 --> 00:55:22,024
to the woman he called
"the love of his life."

1058
00:55:22,026 --> 00:55:24,959
The couple posted
this picture to social media,

1059
00:55:24,961 --> 00:55:27,129
a snapshot of how
he lived his life,

1060
00:55:27,131 --> 00:55:29,600
friends said, always smiling.

1061
00:55:37,106 --> 00:55:41,843
Hey, it was brave,
what you did back there.

1062
00:55:41,845 --> 00:55:45,046
Misguided, but brave.

1063
00:55:45,048 --> 00:55:47,281
Why, man?

1064
00:55:47,283 --> 00:55:48,783
Tell me
that's not your question.

1065
00:55:48,785 --> 00:55:51,153
Why are you
really doing this?

1066
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:56,725
"Some men just want
to watch the world burn."

1067
00:55:56,727 --> 00:55:57,926
That's from "The Dark Knight."

1068
00:55:57,928 --> 00:55:59,660
Yeah, I got
the fucking referencing.

1069
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:01,696
I want to help you, man.

1070
00:56:01,698 --> 00:56:03,765
I don't know.
Why does anybody do anything?

1071
00:56:03,767 --> 00:56:05,834
What the fuck
is taking her so long?

1072
00:56:05,836 --> 00:56:07,301
Do you really know
what to do about this?

1073
00:56:07,303 --> 00:56:10,638
You'll drink something,
I'll pop it back in.

1074
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,607
It'll be chill.

1075
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:13,908
Ish.

1076
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,843
Just don't pick a fight
with me again.

1077
00:56:15,845 --> 00:56:18,080
That's a losing proposition.

1078
00:56:18,082 --> 00:56:19,348
Hey, don't touch him.

1079
00:56:19,350 --> 00:56:23,785
Give me the phone.
Get in the front.

1080
00:56:23,787 --> 00:56:24,986
Scooch.

1081
00:56:29,325 --> 00:56:31,628
Wash those down with that.

1082
00:56:32,629 --> 00:56:35,232
Tastes even better
when it's free, right?

1083
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:41,069
I think we all earned
a nice milkshake for ourselves.

1084
00:56:41,071 --> 00:56:42,703
But nothing's gonna be...

1085
00:56:42,705 --> 00:56:46,040
There's a Jack in the Box
at the end of Sunset.

1086
00:56:46,042 --> 00:56:48,211
You ready, brother?

1087
00:56:49,213 --> 00:56:50,645
I want to kill you.

1088
00:56:50,647 --> 00:56:52,948
Who are you kidding?

1089
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:55,218
You're a good person, dog.

1090
00:56:56,687 --> 00:56:58,690
I shot the clerk
in the liquor store.

1091
00:56:59,789 --> 00:57:01,256
What?

1092
00:57:01,258 --> 00:57:04,660
You shouldn't have
come back for me.

1093
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:06,227
James, that's very gallant,

1094
00:57:06,229 --> 00:57:09,930
but for the time being,
open your mouth.

1095
00:57:09,932 --> 00:57:12,734
Open.
You'll thank me later.

1096
00:57:12,736 --> 00:57:14,403
Fuck! Oh!

1097
00:57:14,405 --> 00:57:17,839
Three, two, one.

1098
00:57:24,948 --> 00:57:28,082
Jess, remember when you
told us you could sing?

1099
00:57:28,084 --> 00:57:30,017
Give us a song.

1100
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:33,055
James back here
is looking pretty grim.

1101
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:35,256

1102
00:57:38,928 --> 00:57:40,731

Bravissima.

1119
00:59:00,343 --> 00:59:02,109
James,
aren't you gonna applaud?

1120
00:59:02,111 --> 00:59:03,912
Bruno, will you please
just stop?

1121
00:59:03,914 --> 00:59:06,314
James, you of all people know
how important applause is.

1122
00:59:06,316 --> 00:59:09,183
Come on, man.
Go on.

1123
00:59:09,185 --> 00:59:11,289
Ovate.

1124
00:59:15,459 --> 00:59:18,062
Yes! Yes.

1125
00:59:24,468 --> 00:59:26,334
Welcome to Jack in the Box.
My name is Shawn.

1126
00:59:26,336 --> 00:59:28,370
Can I interest you
in our late-night

1127
00:59:28,372 --> 00:59:30,272
stacked grilled cheeseburger
munchie meal tonight?

1128
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:31,973
Well, I don't know, Shawn.

1129
00:59:31,975 --> 00:59:33,341
Why don't you walk me through
the late-night

1130
00:59:33,343 --> 00:59:34,875
grilled stacked cheeseburger
munchie meal.

1131
00:59:34,877 --> 00:59:36,544
It's our signature
sourdough Jack

1132
00:59:36,546 --> 00:59:38,345
with a grilled cheese on top,
served with two tacos,

1133
00:59:38,347 --> 00:59:40,048
halfsies curly
and regular fries,

1134
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,582
and a 20-ounce drink
for $6.10 before tax.

1135
00:59:41,584 --> 00:59:44,151
$6.10 before tax?
Sign me up, Shawn.

1136
00:59:44,153 --> 00:59:45,319
What kind of drink
would you like with that?

1137
00:59:45,321 --> 00:59:46,354
Let's do a Dr Pepper.

1138
00:59:46,356 --> 00:59:47,923
Will that be all tonight?

1139
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:50,024
Fuck no! Sorry, Shawn.
Pardon my language.

1140
00:59:50,026 --> 00:59:51,526
You're not religious
or anything, are you?

1141
00:59:51,528 --> 00:59:53,861
Anyway, I'm gonna get
some chicken nuggets

1142
00:59:53,863 --> 00:59:55,330
for my friend Jess in here.

1143
00:59:55,332 --> 00:59:57,098
Would you like the meal
or just the nuggets?

1144
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,433
You know, fuck it, let's get her
some jalapeño poppers too.

1145
00:59:59,435 --> 01:00:00,868
Will that be all tonight?

1146
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:02,870
You just asked that, and no.

1147
01:00:02,872 --> 01:00:05,040
I'd like to get my friend James
something as well.

1148
01:00:05,042 --> 01:00:06,941
James, what would you like?

1149
01:00:06,943 --> 01:00:09,276
He is gonna have
a vanilla milkshake,

1150
01:00:09,278 --> 01:00:11,214
please and thank you, Shawn.

1151
01:00:25,562 --> 01:00:28,029
How are those nuggets, Jess?

1152
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,865
It was always my favorite
in high school...

1153
01:00:29,867 --> 01:00:32,566
get high, come up here.

1154
01:00:32,568 --> 01:00:35,303
Chicken nuggets.

1155
01:00:35,305 --> 01:00:39,908
And a Dr Pepper and curly fries.

1156
01:00:39,910 --> 01:00:41,609
That was the order.

1157
01:00:41,611 --> 01:00:44,347
That was perfection.

1158
01:00:47,383 --> 01:00:49,252
Still mad at your friend James?

1159
01:00:50,921 --> 01:00:52,953
He's no killer.

1160
01:00:52,955 --> 01:00:55,490
What the fuck
are you even talking about?

1161
01:00:55,492 --> 01:00:59,461
We watched. That shot came
from behind the counter, man.

1162
01:00:59,463 --> 01:01:03,098
Probably some paranoid,
trigger-happy NRA dickface

1163
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:04,899
with lousy aim.

1164
01:01:04,901 --> 01:01:06,901
Lucky James.

1165
01:01:06,903 --> 01:01:09,437
Why would you lie about that?

1166
01:01:09,439 --> 01:01:13,975
Probably to make me think
he's capable of killing me.

1167
01:01:13,977 --> 01:01:16,511
I don't know.

1168
01:01:16,513 --> 01:01:18,479
Can't shit a shitter, James.

1169
01:01:18,481 --> 01:01:23,588
These fucking fries
are amazing.

1170
01:01:26,256 --> 01:01:28,526
James, how's that shake, dude?

1171
01:01:29,593 --> 01:01:31,959
I'm just kidding.
I don't care.

1172
01:01:31,961 --> 01:01:34,194
Let's roll, shall we?

1173
01:01:34,196 --> 01:01:38,366
James,
please enter a destination.

1174
01:01:38,368 --> 01:01:40,100
Where to, Bruno?

1175
01:01:40,102 --> 01:01:42,937
Top of Monument,
right off Sunset.

1176
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:44,941
All the way to the dead end.

1177
01:01:46,542 --> 01:01:49,009
What's there?

1178
01:01:49,011 --> 01:01:51,680
A hot tub, obviously.

1179
01:01:51,682 --> 01:01:53,714
Please follow
the highlighted route.

1180
01:01:53,716 --> 01:01:56,216
Honestly, you guys,
I'm feeling a little guilty

1181
01:01:56,218 --> 01:01:57,451
because you both shared

1182
01:01:57,453 --> 01:01:59,486
some really profound shit
with me earlier.

1183
01:01:59,488 --> 01:02:01,522
So I want to share something
with the both of you,

1184
01:02:01,524 --> 01:02:04,725
something that's always
meant a lot to me.

1185
01:02:04,727 --> 01:02:06,962
But I can't do it alone.

1186
01:02:06,964 --> 01:02:08,629
There's gonna be some
chorus shit that you have to do.

1187
01:02:08,631 --> 01:02:10,198
You'll figure it out.

1188
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,600
Now, usually I don't do this,
but, uh,

1189
01:02:13,602 --> 01:02:15,203
go ahead and break 'em off

01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,687
Hey.

1256
01:04:45,689 --> 01:04:48,388
Open the damn door!

1257
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:49,756
Hey, come on,
open the fucking door.

1258
01:04:49,758 --> 01:04:51,792
- Come on. James. James.
- Somebody help us.

1259
01:04:51,794 --> 01:04:53,630
Come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

1260
01:04:58,734 --> 01:04:59,803
James.

1261
01:05:03,339 --> 01:05:05,075
Oh, fuck.

1262
01:05:06,376 --> 01:05:07,609
James!

1263
01:05:07,611 --> 01:05:10,114
The pool.
We need to get in the pool.

1264
01:05:14,584 --> 01:05:15,883
Oh, it's a bad idea.

1265
01:05:15,885 --> 01:05:18,520
- We don't have time.
- Fuck this thing.

1266
01:05:37,473 --> 01:05:38,805
I'm really sorry.

1267
01:05:38,807 --> 01:05:40,610
It's okay.

1268
01:06:20,716 --> 01:06:22,552
Let there be...

1269
01:06:32,328 --> 01:06:34,662
I told you
we were going to a hot tub.

1270
01:06:34,664 --> 01:06:36,200
Get out.

1271
01:06:42,305 --> 01:06:43,507
James...

1272
01:06:44,908 --> 01:06:46,743
You can end the ride now.

1273
01:06:47,943 --> 01:06:49,646
This is our destination.

1274
01:06:55,651 --> 01:06:58,419
I'll be sure to give you
five stars in my review.

1275
01:06:58,421 --> 01:07:00,654
What do you want from us?

1276
01:07:05,562 --> 01:07:08,529
To do just what you said,

1277
01:07:08,531 --> 01:07:10,698
for God's sake.

1278
01:07:10,700 --> 01:07:13,834
Let us sit upon the ground

1279
01:07:13,836 --> 01:07:19,006
and tell sad stories
of the death of kings.

1280
01:07:19,008 --> 01:07:20,975
Strip.

1281
01:07:20,977 --> 01:07:23,678
Bruno, come on, man.

1282
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,946
You wanted to get
in the hot tub, right?

1283
01:07:25,948 --> 01:07:29,316
I mean, that's why we're here,
isn't it?

1284
01:07:29,318 --> 01:07:30,350
I want to go home.

1285
01:07:30,352 --> 01:07:32,620
Don't tell me to let you go

1286
01:07:32,622 --> 01:07:34,656
or that
I'm making you stay here

1287
01:07:34,658 --> 01:07:37,825
or whatever other fake-ass
bullshit you tell yourself

1288
01:07:37,827 --> 01:07:41,895
to justify your fundamentally
unsatisfying existence.

1289
01:07:41,897 --> 01:07:43,566
Because frankly...

1290
01:07:45,035 --> 01:07:46,437
...I won't buy it.

1291
01:07:48,071 --> 01:07:54,441
Now, take off your clothes
and get in the fucking hot tub.

1292
01:07:54,443 --> 01:07:56,446
Off.

1293
01:08:14,363 --> 01:08:16,499
We have to
get the gun.

1294
01:08:26,409 --> 01:08:29,443
Damn, bro.
You work out?

1295
01:08:29,445 --> 01:08:32,015
You too, Jess.

1296
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,399
Bellissima.

1297
01:08:52,401 --> 01:08:54,602
James, you ever kind of wish
you were Italian?

1298
01:08:54,604 --> 01:08:58,038
Those guys get to say whatever
they want about a woman's body,

1299
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,840
and nobody bats an eye.

1300
01:08:59,842 --> 01:09:03,880
Now, get in
the fucking hot tub.

1301
01:09:31,607 --> 01:09:35,678
- I'm gonna take a swig of this.
- You're gonna need it.

1302
01:09:40,850 --> 01:09:42,119
What are you doing?

1303
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:48,456
Oh, "something, something"
desperate times.

1304
01:09:48,458 --> 01:09:51,158
"Something, something"
desperate measures.

1305
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:53,760
- I'm not desperate.
- Jessica.

1306
01:09:53,762 --> 01:09:56,798
Tonight you asked
your cab driver on a date.

1307
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:59,666
Belittle me all you want, Bruno.

1308
01:09:59,668 --> 01:10:01,001
I'm not belittling you.

1309
01:10:01,003 --> 01:10:02,836
That's what you are.
You drive people around.

1310
01:10:02,838 --> 01:10:04,839
You offer them adorable
little bottles of water.

1311
01:10:04,841 --> 01:10:06,541
You do everything
in your power

1312
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:09,042
to block the nagging voice
in your head that says,

1313
01:10:09,044 --> 01:10:11,778
"I will never be
anything other than this."

1314
01:10:11,780 --> 01:10:15,849
And until you acknowledge that,
you never will.

1315
01:10:15,851 --> 01:10:18,219
So is that what this is about?

1316
01:10:18,221 --> 01:10:20,720
You think you're
somehow helping us?

1317
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:22,857
You're an amazing actor, James,

1318
01:10:22,859 --> 01:10:24,992
but no one's ever
gonna know that.

1319
01:10:24,994 --> 01:10:29,162
Because when the time
comes to act, you hesitate.

1320
01:10:29,164 --> 01:10:34,768
You told me you just wanted to
play Richard II before you die.

1321
01:10:34,770 --> 01:10:36,237
And now you're gonna kill me?

1322
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,572
Don't be so banal.

1323
01:10:38,574 --> 01:10:41,675
Tonight isn't about dying.
It's about living.

1324
01:10:42,712 --> 01:10:44,612
If we make it to sunrise,

1325
01:10:44,614 --> 01:10:47,247
you will forever
look back on this night

1326
01:10:47,249 --> 01:10:51,051
and remember what it felt like
to be alive.

1327
01:10:51,053 --> 01:10:53,487
Now, you get to choose.

1328
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:55,425
Who goes first?

1329
01:10:56,559 --> 01:10:58,559
You or her?

1330
01:10:58,561 --> 01:11:00,161
Me, Bruno.

1331
01:11:00,163 --> 01:11:02,332
- Fucking point your gun at me.
- Great.

1332
01:11:06,202 --> 01:11:07,934
Is this Gwyn's house?

1333
01:11:07,936 --> 01:11:10,270
What the fuck did you just say?

1334
01:11:10,272 --> 01:11:14,041
Bruno A.
stands for Bruno Anthony,

1335
01:11:14,043 --> 01:11:17,210
a dead club promoter
they found in Hollywood.

1336
01:11:17,212 --> 01:11:18,946
This guy
doesn't look dead to me.

1337
01:11:18,948 --> 01:11:21,682
I hope I don't look like
a fucking club promoter either.

1338
01:11:21,684 --> 01:11:25,018
They said he's survived
by his fiancée, Gwyneth.

1339
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:28,589
You told us that you suffered
from a recent breakup.

1340
01:11:28,591 --> 01:11:30,791
I believe that.
That's not a lie.

1341
01:11:30,793 --> 01:11:32,693
No, the only thing
you lied about

1342
01:11:32,695 --> 01:11:34,731
is how long ago
it actually happened.

1343
01:11:37,900 --> 01:11:39,936
Go on, Bruno, use your words.

1344
01:11:45,574 --> 01:11:46,909
Get out of the tub!

1345
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:54,782
I knew it.

1346
01:11:54,784 --> 01:11:56,550
Hey, hey,
don't you fucking move, man!

1347
01:11:56,552 --> 01:11:59,085
- I knew I could get you to do...
- Don't listen to him.

1348
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:00,621
...anything.

1349
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:03,724
I knew I could get you
to pick up a girl,

1350
01:12:03,726 --> 01:12:07,929
to commit armed robbery,
to kill somebody.

1351
01:12:07,931 --> 01:12:09,897
Let's just get out of here!

1352
01:12:09,899 --> 01:12:11,866
I guess that somebody's me.

1353
01:12:11,868 --> 01:12:13,033
Fuck you!

1354
01:12:13,035 --> 01:12:15,635
You said
you were just a henchman.

1355
01:12:15,637 --> 01:12:17,837
Now you get to be
a full-on villain.

1356
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:19,273
Fuck this guy, James.
Let's just go.

1357
01:12:19,275 --> 01:12:20,544
Do it.

1358
01:12:21,945 --> 01:12:23,944
Do it!

1359
01:12:23,946 --> 01:12:25,248
Goodbye, Bruno.

1360
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:32,252
James.

1361
01:12:34,923 --> 01:12:36,059
Come on!

1362
01:12:38,226 --> 01:12:40,961
I thought you were my buddy.

1363
01:12:40,963 --> 01:12:44,200
Stay with me, brother.

1364
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:49,540
James!

1365
01:12:57,913 --> 01:13:02,251
Hello, James.
You have one new ride request.

1366
01:13:17,165 --> 01:13:20,671
Ride accepted.
Let's ride.

1367
01:13:29,712 --> 01:13:31,845
Hello, is this Maria?

1368
01:13:31,847 --> 01:13:35,084
This is James.
I'm your ride.

1369
01:13:44,062 --> 01:13:49,062
