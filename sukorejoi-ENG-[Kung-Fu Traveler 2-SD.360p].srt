00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,045
The invasion of the aliens...

2
00:00:45,087 --> 00:00:48,215
had disabled all the thermal weapons
on earth.

3
00:00:48,883 --> 00:00:52,553
Robot No. 1 and engineer Xu Ziying
traveled back...

4
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,597
to the Qing Dynasty
when the martial arts flourished,

5
00:00:54,638 --> 00:00:55,931
and learn the Southern Boxing.

6
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:58,100
With lots of twists and turns,

7
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,519
Robot No. 1 sacrificed itself

8
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,189
so the essence of the Southern Boxing
could be delivered back to us.

9
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,317
The artificial intelligence robots began
to fight back against the aliens,

10
00:01:06,358 --> 00:01:09,278
and the earth is once again peaceful.

11
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,620
We should send out a second robot.

12
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:24,001
Since we're capable of defeating them,

13
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,586
shall we continue with the plan?

14
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,714
But time travel simply
consumes too much energy.

15
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,385
Kung Fu Traveler 2
Northern Leg

16
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:22,930
There are different classes
amongst alien mecha.

17
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:27,559
The alien mecha of higher class
is obviously more powerful.

18
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,520
Keep sending out the robots...

19
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:31,772
to learn more comprehensive
martial art techniques...

20
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,359
in order to deal with
the alien mecha of higher class.

21
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:40,489
Robot No. 2 will be sent to
a pre-determined era

22
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:43,283
to learn the more aggressive
Northern Leg techniques.

23
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,620
Due to the fact that Robot
No. 1 was ambushed by the aliens,

24
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:48,580
No.2 will be equipped with
more advanced...

25
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:49,832
and powerful features.

26
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:50,958
Yes.

27
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,611
Have you completed loading the programs
and the mission commands?

28
00:05:20,154 --> 00:05:22,031
Yes, Director Tiger Chen.

29
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,991
This mission is very dangerous.
Your predecessor...

30
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,284
I will complete the mission.

31
00:05:26,744 --> 00:05:27,953
You're confident.

32
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,079
Because I'm more powerful.

33
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:33,417
Okay. Commander Xu Ziying
will be there waiting for you.

34
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:36,128
Please deliever my message.

35
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:38,422
The video has been turned on.
Go ahead.

36
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:44,595
Take care of yourself!

37
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:25,219
Destination time: September 21, 1898
Northern China 22:18

38
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:07,928
Ah! Is it the immortal, or the devil?

39
00:07:20,107 --> 00:07:21,108
Where?

40
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,110
Over there.

41
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,904
Deleting...

42
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:28,532
Over there.

43
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:29,950
Over here! Over here!

44
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,744
Come over here! Look!

45
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,912
Is he dead?

46
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:34,997
I don't think so.

47
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:36,915
-Dead.
-He's dead?

48
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,208
No, he's not.

49
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:48,302
Is there anything wrong with him?

50
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:49,720
There's nothing wrong with him
at the moment

51
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,431
-He just passed out temporarily.
-Okay.

52
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:00,415
Who am I?

53
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:19,559
Who are you?

54
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,107
What's your full name? Speak!

55
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:27,484
Commander,
he was struck by the lightening...

56
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:28,568
which could have injured his head.

57
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,237
He might suffer from amnesia.

58
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,405
Questioning him now...

59
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,038
Where are you from?
Why are you here?

60
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,542
To find someone.

61
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,755
To find someone?
Who are you trying to find?

62
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:52,259
The master of Northern Leg.
I want to learn the techniques from him.

63
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:58,265
You're quite ambitious!
King of Northern Leg?

64
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,520
He is the grand master of the leg style.

65
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:06,231
He can kick away the flying bullets.

66
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:10,193
That's total nonsense! How come I've
never heard of it? Huh?

67
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:18,243
You're pretty lucky that you didn't die
from being struck by lightning.

68
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:19,911
Consider yourself blessed
with good fortune

69
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,623
How about this?
Stay and be a soldier here.

70
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:27,627
I'll have to give you a name.

71
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:33,675
Since this is the year of the Dog,

72
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:38,347
from now on, your name is A'gou (doggy)

73
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:40,098
-A'gou.
-Yes.

74
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:42,642
A'gou, A'gou.

75
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,989
Hey, A'gou...A'gou!

76
00:10:56,531 --> 00:10:57,824
Have you found the guy called Bei (North)?

77
00:10:57,866 --> 00:10:58,909
No.

78
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:01,995
How about the one called Nan (South)?

79
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:06,541
Nan? If I find Nan, I can find
the King of Northern Leg?

80
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,876
Try it!

81
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:17,302
Hey, A'gou! A'gou!

82
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:20,680
A'gou! Wake up! A'gou!

83
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:34,528
Battery Level

84
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,364
The quartermaster said
you must be hungry.

85
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,698
Hurry up and have your meal!

86
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:47,040
Thank you!

87
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:51,753
If you really want to thank me,
help me wash the clothes.

88
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:16,027
Hey, A'gou, are you washing the clothes?

89
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,238
Can you wash mine too?

90
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:19,906
Put it down.

91
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,743
Thanks, A'gou!

92
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:27,205
Hey, A'gou!
drinks on me later!

93
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:40,051
Thank you, A'gou!

94
00:12:40,093 --> 00:12:41,595
Thank you! Thank you!

95
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:15,670
He has washed the clothes
from everyone in the camp.

96
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,881
Is he stupid or something?

97
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,676
I don't think so.

98
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:25,263
This guy spent the whole night
washing clothes.

99
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:29,601
As a result, everyone in the
camp will accept him as one of their own.

100
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:35,815
The more flawless he seems,

101
00:13:38,235 --> 00:13:40,195
the less I can trust him.

102
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:45,325
So, watch him closely.

103
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,712
Since you're so reluctant to trust
him, why did you take him in?

104
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:02,092
If he is indeed sent by someone,

105
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,971
keeping him close
will help me find the flaws easily.

106
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,620
The King of Northern Leg does exist!

107
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,207
Why don't you believe it?

108
00:14:34,249 --> 00:14:39,588
Once, he was surrounded by more than a
dozen of guns at a dead end.

109
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:44,259
He lifted up his leg...
bang...bang...bang!

110
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:47,429
He kicked away
all the bullets flying toward him.

111
00:14:54,603 --> 00:14:56,146
Commander is suspicious of him,

112
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:57,856
and wants to keep him
under close surveillance.

113
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,190
We can't approach him,

114
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,192
and he doesn't recognize you.

115
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:02,652
This appears to be an issue with the
intelligence part of the program.

116
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,571
There must be something wrong
with the computer.

117
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,367
He does remember...

118
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:11,578
that his mission is to find and learn from
the King of Northern Leg.

119
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,250
Find a street-performer and see if
it'll refresh his memory.

120
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:18,293
Yes.

121
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:30,889
(King of Northern Leg)
Come on! Ladies and gentlemen!

122
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,017
I have studied the martial arts
since my childhood...

123
00:15:34,059 --> 00:15:36,269
and gained some good leg skills.

124
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:42,067
I will show off my skills in front of
all of you today.

125
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:46,446
Nice!

126
00:15:52,535 --> 00:15:53,578
Malfunction. Unable to save.

127
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:01,628
Malfunction. Unable to save.

128
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,714
Malfunction. Unable to save.

129
00:16:07,217 --> 00:16:09,552
Thank you.

130
00:16:11,763 --> 00:16:14,933
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're all ordinary people.

131
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:18,061
It's unavoidable to get hurt.

132
00:16:19,104 --> 00:16:21,606
We must have good medicines with us
at all times.

133
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,525
How about some heat-activating ointment?

134
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:34,786
Hey, why did you stop?

135
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,878
You with the peculiar hairstyle
seem gifted.

136
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:49,008
Are you here to challenge me?

137
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,553
I... I didn't come to fight you.

138
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:55,807
I want to learn your leg skills.
Come on! Show me more moves!

139
00:16:56,683 --> 00:16:58,268
Are you making fun of me?

140
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,769
I'm not.

141
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,896
Come on, show us!

142
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,569
Ok, let's do it.

143
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:12,031
Don't disappoint us.

144
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:15,410
If I lose, I will leave.

145
00:17:15,702 --> 00:17:20,206
If you lose, we can still be friends.

146
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:23,877
Stop!

147
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,010
A'gou, how dare you!

148
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,472
How dare you pick a fight
with a civilian? You...

149
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:39,809
Somebody...

150
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:43,396
escort him back to be disciplined
according to the military law.

151
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,783
Commander, I was wrong.

152
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,078
I'm glad you realized you were wrong.

153
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:04,584
He is not the King of Northern Leg.
I made a mistake.

154
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:09,088
You...you're really good for nothing.

155
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,885
You want to learn the martial arts?

156
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:16,054
Why do you insist on learning from the...

157
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,388
King of Northern Leg?

158
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,433
Can't you just find someone else?

159
00:18:22,018 --> 00:18:24,646
There're so many styles of kung fu
in the world.

160
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:27,607
All of them are established by people.

161
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:33,112
A'gou, you need to learn to
create your own style.

162
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,031
-My own style?
-Yeah!

163
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,574
-Me?
-Yes!

164
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38,117
-Make my own?
-What's wrong with that?

165
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:42,038
Are you not as good as the others?

166
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,542
Achievements are not just
for the privileged.

167
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,836
You can do it if you work hard.

168
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:51,089
A'gou, nobody is born
to be better than the others.

169
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,509
Your only weakness is
your lack of confidence.

170
00:18:55,218 --> 00:18:58,680
When I was 18 years old,

171
00:18:58,721 --> 00:18:59,848
I left home to be a soldier.

172
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,475
At that time,
I had never even worn socks...

173
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:06,980
let alone firing a weapon or
eating western-style food.

174
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:12,652
Look at me now. I have 5,000 soldiers
following me,

175
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:17,490
5,000 guns, 100 horses,
and ten cannons.

176
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:21,411
I accomplished all of these
with my own hands.

177
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,540
I still don't want to create my own style.

178
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:26,833
I just want to find
the King of Northern Leg.

179
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,336
But you can't just wait here.

180
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,633
Do you know the concept of maintaining a
job while looking for a better one?

181
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:37,385
Maintaining a job
while looking for a better one?

182
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,304
Yes. How about this...

183
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,349
From now on, learn from Cuckoo first.

184
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,310
No way!

185
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,147
Why? Her leg skills aren't bad.

186
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:52,317
You'll benefit a lot from her.

187
00:19:52,901 --> 00:19:54,068
I don't want to learn from her.

188
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:56,362
I don't fight women and
I don't want to break my own rules.

189
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,198
Him?

190
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:06,289
A'gou, you need to realize when there's
something good in front of you.

191
00:20:06,873 --> 00:20:08,625
You're in no position to be picky

192
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,046
Fine, go find Instructor Xu.

193
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,381
Let her find you a master.

194
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,552
Commander, release me first.

195
00:20:35,902 --> 00:20:38,196
I have sent someone to check on
that street performer,

196
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:41,282
but he was killed. I suspect...

197
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,409
It was Cuckoo who killed him.

198
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:46,287
Commander...

199
00:20:47,747 --> 00:20:51,250
Regardless if he has anything to do
with A'gou,

200
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:54,087
we can't take any chances.

201
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:57,924
What if he's not what you think he is?

202
00:20:58,591 --> 00:21:02,929
If A'gou is just an idiot who has a clean
background, that's even better!

203
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:09,102
If he's just an idiot,
why do you want to cultivate him?

204
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:14,941
If an idiot can turn into a master
under my cultivation,

205
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:18,903
wouldn't that benefit me as well?

206
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,738
Then this troop of strong soldiers...

207
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:24,575
will be even more willing to make it big
with me in the future.

208
00:21:34,043 --> 00:21:35,628
I'm from the school of
Chuojiao (Kicking Feet).

209
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,422
Chen practices Tantui (Bouncing Leg).

210
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,591
These are the most famous styles
in the North.

211
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,388
He doesn't even know how to properly
greet the masters?

212
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:49,559
A'gou, you should put your fists
together and bow to us.

213
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,354
Masters, please accept
my sincere greetings.

214
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:58,901
Tantui is divided into Linqing Tantui,
Shaolin Tantui and Jiaomen Tantui.

215
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:01,279
I practice the Linqing Tantui.

216
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,530
There is a saying that goes like...

217
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:03,948
those who practice boxing
without any leg skills,

218
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,158
will always be clumsy.

219
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,203
There is another saying that says
the leg is the key to defeat.

220
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,081
Another one also says...

221
00:22:12,123 --> 00:22:15,084
Tantui are like having four hands,
it's feared by human and spirits.

222
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:17,128
How about that? Awesome, right?

223
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:18,629
I don't know.

224
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,882
You don't know?

225
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,885
How would I know if you're awesome
without seeing it?

226
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,221
Zhiguo, why don't you show A'gou
a few moves?

227
00:22:29,307 --> 00:22:30,308
No problem!

228
00:22:32,393 --> 00:22:33,895
The characteristic of Tantui is...

229
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:35,646
when you lift your leg, it won't be higher
than the knee.

230
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:49,827
There is an old saying that...

231
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,330
Chuojiao will follow after the hips turn.

232
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:55,208
Zhang, your Chuojiao is quite powerful.

233
00:22:56,918 --> 00:23:00,046
Zhiguo, Commander
has found us a good student.

234
00:23:02,048 --> 00:23:05,843
Don't gloat yet.
Have you got it all? Show us.

235
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,386
A'gou, come on.

236
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:26,906
I realized something this morning. He
learns fast but forgets it even faster.

237
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,533
Really?

238
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:39,418
After the class of Theories of War
at 10:10,

239
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,379
he went to Chen Zhiguo to learn Tantui.

240
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,757
He was taught two moves
in an hour and ten minutes.

241
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,717
In the beginning,
he learned fast and proficiently.

242
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,678
But he forgot them all at the end.

243
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,930
Chen Zhiguo was very angry
and yelled at him for ten minutes.

244
00:23:51,597 --> 00:23:53,057
He had lunch at 12 o'clock.

245
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,310
At 12:30, he went to Zhang Qi
to learn Chuojiao

246
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,272
He spent two hours learning but could not
remember any of it at the end.

247
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:06,445
His computer system
must be fixed manually.

248
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:10,741
But if he can't recognize you,
will he accept the manual repair?

249
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,203
It'll be difficult to do it here.

250
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,122
We must figure out a way
to take him to the base.

251
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:17,623
Yes.

252
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:29,010
Oh man...I'm not sick.

253
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:31,304
I am really not sick.

254
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,597
Man...

255
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:36,517
-There's nothing wrong with me.
-Come on.

256
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,269
I'm really not sick.

257
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,520
It's just a checkup.

258
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,442
Doctor, I think
there is something wrong with his brain.

259
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,027
He learns really fast,

260
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:50,114
but he forgets even faster
and remembers nothing at all.

261
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,075
That's right, doc.
please check him thoroughly.

262
00:24:57,205 --> 00:25:01,250
From the look of your hairstyle,
you might be suffering from...

263
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,835
hyperactivity of yang fire due to
yin deficiency.

264
00:25:05,713 --> 00:25:07,256
Doctor, I'm not sick.

265
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,842
You don't even have a pulse,
how can you say you're okay?

266
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:12,178
Activating biomimetic mode...

267
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:17,850
He went to the traditional Chinese medical
center in Jin'an district.

268
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,812
Is everything ready to go at the base?

269
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:22,897
Yes.

270
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,038
Your pulse seems to be stabilized now.
Here, I'll write you a prescription.

271
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,545
Get your herbal medicine according to
this prescription.

272
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,095
Cupping

273
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:58,057
What kind of kung fu is this?
I want to try it, too.

274
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,729
Are you going out?

275
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,691
I'm going to check on the store.

276
00:26:06,732 --> 00:26:09,902
How many times have I told you?

277
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,531
That store's not going to
make much money for you.

278
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,866
There's no need for you to work so hard.

279
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:20,621
If you were with me, you wouldn't need to
worry about anything ever again.

280
00:26:24,959 --> 00:26:27,086
Commander, is there anything I can help
you with?

281
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:31,966
Look...It's about...

282
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:35,720
I want to invite the people from
the German Embassy to lunch.

283
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,847
I would like you to be my interpreter.

284
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,058
I will arrange someone to go with you.

285
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:46,272
No...you know these foreigners
are cunning as a fox.

286
00:26:46,856 --> 00:26:50,943
I feel reassured only
when you're by my side.

287
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:55,698
I need to go to the store today as...

288
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,700
I have something to deal with there.

289
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:06,542
Fine, just forget what I have said.

290
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,888
Zhiguo, we have never gone this way before

291
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,514
Can we make it through?

292
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,059
-Don't worry, I have a plan.
-Okay.

293
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:36,030
Gu Feng Antique

294
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,505
Gentlemen...

295
00:27:55,257 --> 00:27:56,509
please follow me.

296
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,596
Let's go.

297
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:06,060
Gentlemen, please take a look...

298
00:28:06,102 --> 00:28:08,270
at the blue and white pottery of
Ming Dynasty.

299
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:18,614
Instructor! Why are you here?

300
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,033
This is my store.

301
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,619
Oh I see.

302
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,166
Come over here.

303
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,709
Okay.

304
00:28:34,547 --> 00:28:38,884
Do you feel that you've seen me before?
That there's something familiar about me?

305
00:28:39,885 --> 00:28:41,595
Do you know why?

306
00:28:43,764 --> 00:28:45,558
Because you're my instructor.

307
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:50,354
Because we have a certain connection.

308
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:56,193
You're not human.
You're a robot from the future.

309
00:28:57,778 --> 00:28:59,613
And I am your guide.

310
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,411
What are you talking about?
I don't understand at all.

311
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:21,760
It doesn't hurt, does it?

312
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,390
A big wound like this but yet it's not
bleeding?

313
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:28,934
Do you think you're just gifted?

314
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:32,605
How many gifted people
are made out of metal?

315
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,614
I have waited for you for 17 years.

316
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,746
Instructor. Are you messing with me?

317
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:56,921
I know I lost my memory, but you
shouldn't mess with me like that.

318
00:29:57,588 --> 00:30:00,299
My body is strong like the steel.

319
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:03,260
I have the invincible armor to block
all swords and spears.

320
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:06,055
Listen to me, you're a robot!

321
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,645
I know machines, I've seen them
at the Commander's house.

322
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:18,067
There are machines that make bullets, and
machines that build cannons.

323
00:30:18,108 --> 00:30:21,862
If a machine can become a person,
it should be called a "Machine Goblin".

324
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,782
I can fix you.

325
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:29,453
I can make you remember
everything you have ever learned.

326
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:40,422
Put it on.

327
00:30:42,424 --> 00:30:44,593
-What are you doing?
-I'm fixing you.

328
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,222
Fine.

329
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,956
Hey, how did you put me inside there?

330
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,583
Matching...

331
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,419
Have you completed loading the programs
and the mission commands?

332
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,045
Percentage Matched

333
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:23,591
This mission is very dangerous.
Your predecessor...

334
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,932
Take care of yourself!

335
00:31:34,727 --> 00:31:35,728
I remember it now.

336
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:40,399
You must be my family member
from the previous life.

337
00:31:42,735 --> 00:31:45,779
No wonder your image is always in my mind.

338
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,615
It must be our destiny.

339
00:31:48,574 --> 00:31:50,909
This is me from the previous life,
right?

340
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,204
What's up with his outfit?

341
00:31:56,915 --> 00:32:00,044
I guess we can live with your current
comprehension of the situation

342
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:03,047
What are you waiting for then?
Heal me.

343
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:04,798
Cure me.

344
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,077
Both of you were drunk.

345
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,579
-We drank?
-Yes.

346
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:36,705
Why?

347
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:39,375
I don't know why.
You two wanted me to drink with you.

348
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,417
Then both of you got drunk...

349
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:43,003
and I had to hire a carriage
to take us back.

350
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:05,818
Teach me Chuojiao.

351
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,653
You still want to learn it?

352
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:10,447
-Man...
-Hurry up and teach me!

353
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,200
-Fine, watch carefully then.
-Okay.

354
00:33:27,798 --> 00:33:30,592
I remember it now.
Really. I do!

355
00:33:31,135 --> 00:33:32,928
Can you really remember?

356
00:33:46,191 --> 00:33:47,526
He's doing it.

357
00:33:57,786 --> 00:33:58,954
Take care of yourself!

358
00:34:01,874 --> 00:34:03,250
Take care of yourself!

359
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:12,217
I thought...
I have forgotten what you look like.

360
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,556
The moment I saw Robot No.2,

361
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,558
I realized...

362
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:28,525
you have always been in my heart.

363
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:10,442
There are two reasons why I stayed with
the Commander for 17 years.

364
00:35:11,026 --> 00:35:14,196
First, I know you will travel back
to this point in time.

365
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,950
Second, I'll need to rely on the
Commander...

366
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,451
to find the King of Northern Leg.

367
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,579
According to the historical records,

368
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:25,165
Commander wrote a book...

369
00:35:25,207 --> 00:35:27,459
and that's the first time the
King of Northern Leg was mentioned.

370
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,337
I have asked him about it several times,

371
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:33,423
but he didn't seem to be familiar
with him.

372
00:35:38,929 --> 00:35:42,808
Maybe this King of Northern Leg
won't appear for a few more years?

373
00:35:45,936 --> 00:35:46,979
Instructor, you're so awesome!

374
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,439
If that's the case, your battery will...

375
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:52,442
And the ongoing war in the future will...

376
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,112
Instructor!

377
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:00,701
Instructor, you're talking nonsense again.

378
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,996
I don't understand any of those nonsense.

379
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:09,126
You need to be treated again. Let's go.

380
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:12,754
Instructor...I'm here to pay
for my treatments.

381
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,133
It's not enough?

382
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,219
It didn't cost me this much when I went
to the traditional Chinese doctor...

383
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:20,429
who gave me a big pack of medicine.

384
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,513
Instructor...

385
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:25,392
-Come with me!
-Instructor...

386
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,186
I'm fine now. I'm healed.

387
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:31,398
I'm totally fine. Goodbye, Instructor.

388
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,733
Wait!

389
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:35,152
Wait a minute!

390
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:39,740
Instructor! I'm a human and not a robot.
I'm the same as everybody else.

391
00:36:39,781 --> 00:36:43,660
If I were a robot, how could I eat, drink,
pee and poo?

392
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:46,330
That's the biomimetic features
in your program.

393
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,664
The way you learn martial arts
is different from that of others.

394
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,708
You're using a 30-megapixel camera

395
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,834
to capture the images...

396
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,252
which are then analyzed and stored...

397
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:54,504
with the quad-core processor.

398
00:36:54,546 --> 00:36:58,258
Theoretically, you're able to learn
what see instantaneously...

399
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,052
and use what you've just learned.

400
00:37:00,093 --> 00:37:02,721
It's like having many small minions
working overtime in your brain.

401
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:04,681
Right. What's wrong with that?

402
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,850
-That's how everyone is.
-Human's memory...

403
00:37:06,892 --> 00:37:07,935
Wait a minute.

404
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,896
Can you slice the brain in half
and show me?

405
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:12,481
Maybe we both have small minions...

406
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:14,900
working overtime in our brains.
See you, Instructor!

407
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,823
Should we just tie a rope around him
and force him back here?

408
00:37:21,865 --> 00:37:25,077
No. The programs in his system are
somewhat messed up.

409
00:37:25,786 --> 00:37:27,412
Don't over-stimulate him.

410
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,927
Commander.

411
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:44,262
Looking for the Kind of Northern Leg?

412
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:46,056
Yes.

413
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:50,102
We need your help to find him.

414
00:37:50,435 --> 00:37:51,520
But...

415
00:37:51,561 --> 00:37:53,021
It's you who asked me to teach him
kung fu.

416
00:37:53,397 --> 00:37:55,857
Although he has learned the leg skills of
the two different branches,

417
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,443
he has not been able to master it fully.

418
00:37:59,861 --> 00:38:03,281
That's easy. There's no need to find that
King of Northern Leg.

419
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,451
It's just a bottleneck in his training.

420
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:09,454
Let him go and challenge others.

421
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,248
Challenge?

422
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:15,127
Yeah. It'll improve his skills while he
practices how to survive.

423
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,795
When I was young,

424
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:21,466
I challenged dozens of martial
arts schools in the country.

425
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,427
That's how I achieved
everything I have today.

426
00:38:25,429 --> 00:38:29,224
It's decided then. I will take him myself.

427
00:38:29,933 --> 00:38:32,811
Let's find the schools known
for the leg skills.

428
00:38:32,853 --> 00:38:35,981
We'll be able to get the secret scroll of
each martial art branch,

429
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:38,525
and combine their best as our own.

430
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,758
Good job!

431
00:40:24,381 --> 00:40:25,423
Excellent!

432
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,556
Let's go, A'gou!

433
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,276
Welcome back, Commander.

434
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,374
Take a seat.

435
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,134
Brothers, thank you for your hard work
in the past few days.

436
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:12,512
Today, let's have a feast.

437
00:41:13,138 --> 00:41:14,389
Come on.

438
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:16,099
Okay.

439
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,570
Commander, should we ask him to come over?

440
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:35,160
No, just let him read.

441
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,289
I wasn't wrong about him.

442
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:42,083
He challenged eight schools in seven days.

443
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:47,339
What we've acquired is worth 10 years
of work from him.

444
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:50,800
Martial art training is about virtue.

445
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,803
You teaching him like this...

446
00:41:57,224 --> 00:42:01,519
Go to the kitchen and ask them to cook
more dishes for all of us.

447
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,188
Go ahead.

448
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:07,734
Come on.

449
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:17,035
You two, help serve our brothers.
Enjoy!

450
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,755
All these years,

451
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:31,258
don't you have the ambition
to conquer the world?

452
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:34,219
I'm talking about A'gou.

453
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,722
It's the same thing.

454
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,768
Why do people want to learn
the martial arts?

455
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,356
It's to be the number one in the world.

456
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:51,069
When he gains power via learning
the martial arts,

457
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,739
he will desire more.

458
00:42:56,032 --> 00:42:59,619
For me, my desire is to be the top.

459
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,039
I need your help.

460
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,750
I'm not interested.

461
00:43:07,294 --> 00:43:09,587
You won't even do it for me?

462
00:43:10,797 --> 00:43:16,094
Our deal was for me to help you
seven years.

463
00:43:17,012 --> 00:43:19,597
And this year is the last year.

464
00:43:21,266 --> 00:43:26,604
You're forcing me
to make a move early.

465
00:43:45,457 --> 00:43:49,961
It has been seven years.
Don't you know my heart at all?

466
00:43:52,922 --> 00:43:54,007
What do you mean?

467
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:58,219
What were you doing?
You didn't come back for dinner...

468
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,763
and kept Commander waiting.

469
00:44:00,555 --> 00:44:01,931
-Go sit down.
-Yes.

470
00:44:03,099 --> 00:44:07,270
A'gou, here, sit by my side.

471
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:13,777
Let me ask you...did you learn anything?

472
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:14,903
Yes.

473
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:18,948
Great. I will take you to another one
tomorrow.

474
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:24,162
But it's not a martial arts school,
but a security agency.

475
00:44:24,204 --> 00:44:25,372
Security agency?

476
00:44:25,413 --> 00:44:29,667
The top master of the agency has a scroll
of Leg skills from Shaolin Temple.

477
00:44:30,752 --> 00:44:35,006
With it, your leg skills will definitely
improve to a whole new level.

478
00:44:43,306 --> 00:44:47,685
Shun Yuan Security Agency

479
00:44:59,364 --> 00:45:00,657
Commander Yuan,

480
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:03,118
the judicial commissioner of
Qing Dynasty is here to see Mr. Tan.

481
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,888
The top master's last name is Wang, right?

482
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:25,306
Who is Mr. Tan?

483
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,977
Mr. Tan lives in this agency.

484
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:30,019
Oh.

485
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:32,689
So are we here to challenge them?

486
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:35,859
Of course.
We're definitely here to challenge them.

487
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,070
It's not just a routine challenge, do your
best and have no mercy.

488
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:43,366
A'gou, don't make me regret
all of the work we put in on you.

489
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,784
Don't worry, Commander.

490
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,585
Excuse our poor hospitality.
Please forgive me.

491
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,257
Mr. Tan, how have you been?

492
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,887
This top master looks so average.

493
00:46:04,512 --> 00:46:07,056
I hear Commander has challenged
a lot of martial arts schools.

494
00:46:07,098 --> 00:46:09,559
I was wondering how the commander got the
leisure time to challenge the schools...

495
00:46:09,601 --> 00:46:10,852
when you're already busy in dealing with
the military affairs.

496
00:46:12,061 --> 00:46:14,606
I guess Commander just want to see me?

497
00:46:16,858 --> 00:46:21,696
Mr. Tan is indeed outspoken and witty.

498
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:26,910
Exactly. I came just for you today.

499
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:30,955
You could have sent an invitation.
I would've happily accepted it.

500
00:46:32,457 --> 00:46:34,876
I have to avoid being noticed.

501
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,587
A relationship between an officer in the
imperial court and a military town...

502
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:41,341
is strictly forbidden, not to mention a
crucial member like Mr. Tan.

503
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,093
Oh, that's an overstatement.

504
00:46:44,844 --> 00:46:48,598
Mr. Tan,
I would like us to be sworn brothers.

505
00:46:49,224 --> 00:46:52,727
You're in the imperial court while
I'm in control of the army.

506
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,897
Thank you for your
kindness, Commander.

507
00:46:56,147 --> 00:46:58,942
Unfortunately, I have no such plan.

508
00:46:59,776 --> 00:47:02,737
I know. It's not because Mr. Tan
thinks any less of me,

509
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,948
but rather it's to avoid the rumors.

510
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,910
Fine, how about...

511
00:47:09,661 --> 00:47:11,120
Let's bet on it.

512
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:14,374
Bet?

513
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:19,963
I hear that Master Wang...

514
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,215
is the top monk from the Shaolin Temple.

515
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:25,301
It just happens that
I have a young soldier...

516
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,971
in my camp who doesn't know
his own place and wants to...

517
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:30,014
come and learn from him.

518
00:47:30,056 --> 00:47:32,892
If he wins, let's be sworn brothers.

519
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,686
What can people say about that? Right?

520
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:37,981
How can such an important matter be
decided based on a bet?

521
00:47:39,607 --> 00:47:43,361
A small bet is just for fun.
Mr. Tan, you have to raise the stake.

522
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:49,867
Director Wang has a scroll of
Leg skills from Shaolin Temple

523
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,452
Why don't we put that in
our little bet as well?

524
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:58,209
No. I will not agree to this.

525
00:47:59,252 --> 00:48:04,424
I'm not going to return
empty handed today.

526
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:21,399
Is Mr. Tan really not from our
Tantui School?

527
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:24,819
Lower your voice.
Mr. Tan is the backbone of the country,

528
00:48:24,861 --> 00:48:26,904
and very much valued by the emperor.

529
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,574
Then he definitely doesn't know Tantui.

530
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:37,123
I would like to see this young man myself.

531
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,919
Mr. Tan, please allow me to accept this
challenge.

532
00:49:07,111 --> 00:49:10,865
You came to challenge us,
so according to the rules...

533
00:49:10,907 --> 00:49:13,076
I get to choose the weapon.

534
00:49:16,371 --> 00:49:20,458
This is the Five Tigers Chopping Sword
that made me famous.

535
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,463
It's 3 feet and 7 inches long,
and weights 8 jins and 4 liangs.

536
00:49:30,426 --> 00:49:31,469
Please.

537
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:53,491
Shaolin Tantui

538
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:30,194
Danger

539
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:40,705
Why is Instructor Xu here?

540
00:50:53,551 --> 00:50:54,552
Kill him.

541
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,391
Kill him.

542
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:02,935
Okay.

543
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,706
Warning

544
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:25,374
Do Not Violate the
Three Rules for Robots

545
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:28,294
Good.

546
00:52:21,013 --> 00:52:23,307
Bro...

547
00:52:24,058 --> 00:52:25,935
Bro...

548
00:52:28,521 --> 00:52:33,901
Mr. Tan, two of your men
are fighting my guy.

549
00:52:34,944 --> 00:52:37,989
Isn't that against the rules?

550
00:52:38,614 --> 00:52:41,576
Bro! Bro!

551
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:53,796
Come over here.

552
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,551
I will take A'gou to see a doctor.

553
00:53:06,976 --> 00:53:10,521
Mr. Tan, a bet is a bet. Admit defeat.

554
00:53:12,064 --> 00:53:14,859
What else do you have to say?

555
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:52,730
I was possessed by an alien just now.
He was going to kill you through me.

556
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:55,149
What?

557
00:53:55,191 --> 00:53:57,902
Robots are programed to never hurt
a human.

558
00:53:58,361 --> 00:53:59,570
It's one of the Three Rules
for Robots.

559
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:03,240
If a robot violates the rules,
it will self-destruct.

560
00:54:04,951 --> 00:54:06,786
So it turns out I'm really not a human.

561
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,041
It's a relief that the malfunction
wasn't serious

562
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:15,252
It's not all bad news since
you got your memory back.

563
00:54:18,381 --> 00:54:23,552
However, the aliens found me which means
they'll definitely come back for you.

564
00:54:24,053 --> 00:54:25,179
I'm not afraid.

565
00:54:35,106 --> 00:54:39,568
If it can possess me, it can possess
anybody around you.

566
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:44,949
I don't have much time left.
I will get weaker and weaker.

567
00:54:46,075 --> 00:54:49,078
So I must learn the Northern Leg as
soon as possible and complete the mission.

568
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:53,958
But I still haven't found the
King of Northern Leg.

569
00:54:54,625 --> 00:55:00,047
I have learned the Chuojiao, Tantui, and
the secret scrolls from various schools.

570
00:55:00,673 --> 00:55:03,509
As soon as I have thoroughly
mastered them, I can create my own style.

571
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:42,965
Northern Leg

572
00:55:44,467 --> 00:55:46,218
According to the imperial decree,

573
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:50,389
our troop will be in charge of the defense
affairs such as patrolling the streets,

574
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:53,434
and civilian security and protection.

575
00:55:55,561 --> 00:55:59,398
All of you were cultivated by me.

576
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:02,401
We are all brothers risking our lives for
each other.

577
00:56:02,443 --> 00:56:06,072
From now on, I hope you can
show me the morale and...

578
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:08,699
the spirit of a new army.

579
00:56:08,741 --> 00:56:10,910
Are you confident?

580
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:16,207
Hail Commander!

581
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:17,917
Great.

582
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:23,255
Let him through.

583
00:56:32,890 --> 00:56:37,561
A'gou, how dare you come back?

584
00:56:38,521 --> 00:56:41,607
You think the military law is a joke?

585
00:56:42,733 --> 00:56:43,984
Commander,

586
00:56:44,026 --> 00:56:46,695
I couldn't move from my injuries...

587
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,115
and have taken some time to recover.

588
00:56:50,241 --> 00:56:53,369
I think you were hiding so you can
practice your martial arts.

589
00:56:53,744 --> 00:56:56,622
How do you feel now after such a long
practice?

590
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:59,375
Can you use your legs to kick away
the bullets?

591
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,751
I...

592
00:57:02,753 --> 00:57:05,798
Useless! I'm telling you,

593
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,510
with a sufficient distance and
fast leg skills,

594
00:57:09,552 --> 00:57:11,512
you'll be able to kick away
the bullets with your legs.

595
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:17,935
You have practiced for so long.
Don't you want to try it out?

596
00:57:19,728 --> 00:57:22,356
Commander,
I'm willing to give it a try.

597
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:27,278
Brilliant! I'll see you on the field.

598
00:58:19,288 --> 00:58:20,748
This move...

599
00:58:20,789 --> 00:58:23,334
is Chuojiao's
"Eight Immortals Birthday Feast".

600
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:28,130
That's perfect.

601
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:33,969
I don't want my soldiers
to blindly follow the so-called authority.

602
00:58:34,011 --> 00:58:38,390
I want you to be the authority,
your own authority.

603
00:58:38,974 --> 00:58:41,310
-Hail Commander!
-Hail Commander!

604
00:58:57,201 --> 00:58:58,369
Instructor Xu.

605
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:01,956
How can I help you?

606
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:06,585
We had a deal. I'll leave...

607
00:59:06,919 --> 00:59:08,212
if you start a war.

608
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,673
I've helped you train the new soldiers...

609
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:12,466
but I won't help a tyrant to victimize
his subjects.

610
00:59:14,426 --> 00:59:16,971
Instructor Xu, you don't understand.

611
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:21,558
Mr. Tan and I are friends now.

612
00:59:24,061 --> 00:59:25,729
He's formed an alliance with you?

613
00:59:38,242 --> 00:59:40,369
As long as he's not against me,

614
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:42,997
the country will be mine
sooner or later.

615
00:59:43,038 --> 00:59:45,249
He is loyal to the imperial court.

616
00:59:46,041 --> 00:59:48,627
A hero's born when the sword's pulled;

617
00:59:49,128 --> 00:59:52,047
but the suffering of the commoners lasts
for decades.

618
00:59:53,757 --> 00:59:57,094
I've dealt with him for so long for
the sake of the commoners

619
00:59:57,511 --> 00:59:59,930
If he still can't appreciate my kindness,

620
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:03,934
then I'll have to...kill him.

621
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,232
You are still going to start a war.

622
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:15,612
Birds of different feathers
don't flock together

623
01:00:18,032 --> 01:00:19,450
Did I say you can go?

624
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:25,289
You're trying to have her make me stay?

625
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:28,751
Don't make me do this.

626
01:00:29,585 --> 01:00:30,627
Ziying,

627
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:36,133
I really don't want to lose our
seven years of friendship.

628
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,763
You're on your own. Good luck.

629
01:00:52,941 --> 01:00:53,942
Kung fu.

630
01:00:54,735 --> 01:00:56,111
Were you surprised?

631
01:00:56,153 --> 01:00:58,530
Small things like this
is not worth my time.

632
01:00:58,572 --> 01:01:00,616
What I want are sizable troops of
soldiers, horses...

633
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:03,160
and the whole country.

634
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:13,545
I'll give you two days...

635
01:01:14,797 --> 01:01:17,591
to deal with that ragged store.

636
01:01:18,384 --> 01:01:19,802
Bring A'gou back, too.

637
01:01:21,595 --> 01:01:23,389
Whether it's our seven years
of relationship,

638
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:25,099
or my cultivation for A'gou,

639
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,644
both of you should pay me back.

640
01:01:31,897 --> 01:01:35,067
You promised me
you wouldn't start a war.

641
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:38,946
I regret it now.

642
01:02:03,762 --> 01:02:05,097
I will teach him a lesson.

643
01:02:05,848 --> 01:02:08,100
He is quite smart.
You might not be a match for him.

644
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:11,061
It's my fault.

645
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,441
Coming from the future,
I have underestimated this era.

646
01:02:16,567 --> 01:02:20,237
It seems that...
if he was born in our time,

647
01:02:20,612 --> 01:02:22,281
he would have been a fierce hero too.

648
01:02:22,948 --> 01:02:25,909
Him? Is he more brilliant than
Director Tiger Chen?

649
01:02:29,288 --> 01:02:32,749
These two are completely different people.

650
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:37,087
Regardless what era he's in,

651
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:39,756
Commander can't stand to be alone.

652
01:02:41,592 --> 01:02:43,927
Whatever it is, there's something off
about him.

653
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,391
He looks at you as if you belong to him

654
01:02:52,561 --> 01:02:56,356
I have devoted seven years of my life to
help him, after all.

655
01:02:57,608 --> 01:03:00,569
I also have hundreds of years of
experience ahead of this era.

656
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:03,864
I had a deal with him.

657
01:03:05,032 --> 01:03:06,408
He can't start a war,

658
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:10,412
hurt the innocent,
or dominate the country.

659
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,789
He wants to dominate the country?

660
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,335
It has already started.

661
01:03:17,753 --> 01:03:20,547
He's been building up his personal
influences, training the new soldiers,

662
01:03:21,507 --> 01:03:23,008
controlling the local districts,

663
01:03:23,634 --> 01:03:26,386
and forming alliances with different
ministers of the imperial court.

664
01:03:26,970 --> 01:03:30,224
Why did Mr. Tan form an alliance
with the Commander?

665
01:03:31,350 --> 01:03:34,728
Was it really because he lost the
martial arts challenge?

666
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,524
Of course not!

667
01:03:39,441 --> 01:03:41,568
He knows the Commander's ambitions.

668
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,696
He did it to keep the Commander at bay...

669
01:03:44,738 --> 01:03:46,740
to buy more time for the imperial court.

670
01:03:47,366 --> 01:03:50,827
According to the history,
Commander will...

671
01:03:51,286 --> 01:03:54,248
kill him and start a rebellion
in a few days.

672
01:03:54,831 --> 01:03:57,292
This war will last for decades.

673
01:03:59,294 --> 01:04:00,337
What can we do?

674
01:04:01,296 --> 01:04:03,173
Kill him?

675
01:04:04,967 --> 01:04:06,843
The problem is...

676
01:04:06,885 --> 01:04:08,929
I can't kill those who had
been mentioned in any recorded history.

677
01:04:09,596 --> 01:04:13,809
If we change the history,
the consequence will be devastating.

678
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:19,481
That is the number one rule
for time travelers.

679
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:28,699
Take off your shoes.

680
01:04:37,916 --> 01:04:39,835
Actually, I don't need to wear shoes.

681
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,545
Stop talking.

682
01:04:43,422 --> 01:04:48,135
You are missing Director Chen
as you sew my shoes?

683
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:54,141
Ah...I'm right. Shall we talk about it?

684
01:04:55,559 --> 01:04:57,269
What's the point of chatting with a robot?

685
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,939
I know about what happened with
Robot No.1

686
01:05:01,857 --> 01:05:03,900
You practiced Southern Boxing...

687
01:05:04,526 --> 01:05:07,696
when something's bothering you.

688
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,032
Am I right?

689
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:15,078
When did you become a fortune-teller?

690
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:19,541
Then tell me, when will I marry?

691
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:26,256
It's not likely in this lifetime.

692
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:28,508
Why?

693
01:05:29,259 --> 01:05:33,263
Because you are still in love with
Director Chen from the future.

694
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:37,059
When you talk about Director Chen,
your temperature rises by two degree,

695
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,769
and your voice pitch dropped.

696
01:05:41,355 --> 01:05:45,233
Go and pack up. We'll head out
to find the King of Northern Leg.

697
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:50,238
No. I want to see the history that
you mentioned.

698
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,366
-Why?
-Because I'm curious.

699
01:06:05,754 --> 01:06:07,798
Are all of these true?

700
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:10,634
Yes.

701
01:06:13,095 --> 01:06:15,597
Commander deserves to die.
I'm going to kill him.

702
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,894
Maybe the future would be better
if the history was changed?

703
01:06:20,936 --> 01:06:22,979
Without the decades-long war,

704
01:06:23,021 --> 01:06:25,357
maybe the country
would be in a better shape.

705
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:29,027
Then when the aliens invade us in the
future, we wouldn't fail.

706
01:06:30,946 --> 01:06:32,322
It's possible.

707
01:06:32,823 --> 01:06:36,660
However, countless lives may disappear,

708
01:06:38,161 --> 01:06:39,996
including you and me.

709
01:06:41,748 --> 01:06:42,874
Are you afraid?

710
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,588
I wouldn't be here if I'm afraid of dying.

711
01:06:51,591 --> 01:06:54,970
I have another idea. Why don't I try to
persuade the Commander...

712
01:06:55,512 --> 01:06:57,055
not to kill Mr. Tan.

713
01:06:58,098 --> 01:06:59,266
You?

714
01:06:59,307 --> 01:07:00,767
Yes, me.

715
01:07:05,564 --> 01:07:07,399
They're inside...

716
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:12,362
It doesn't look like he'll give us
a chance to do so.

717
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:37,763
Let's go.

718
01:07:47,022 --> 01:07:49,107
There's no one on the left,
keep going that way.

719
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,234
I'll stall them.

720
01:07:52,861 --> 01:07:54,029
Let's go together.

721
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:56,406
Go now or
we won't be able to leave at all.

722
01:08:03,747 --> 01:08:08,084
A'gou. I won't spoil you anymore. Fire!

723
01:08:54,172 --> 01:08:55,841
Cannoneer, you're up.

724
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:03,014
Ready...

725
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,183
Fire!

726
01:09:10,355 --> 01:09:12,107
Where did he go?

727
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:28,999
Inside...

728
01:09:33,712 --> 01:09:35,422
Over there...

729
01:09:35,463 --> 01:09:37,340
Fire...

730
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,094
Fire...

731
01:10:00,363 --> 01:10:03,199
Let's talk, alone.

732
01:10:21,718 --> 01:10:24,554
Okay. What is it?

733
01:10:24,888 --> 01:10:26,431
I'm not an ordinary person.

734
01:10:34,064 --> 01:10:36,691
This is not some kind of trick.
You may touch it.

735
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:46,576
Actually, I've figured it out
a long time ago.

736
01:10:47,869 --> 01:10:49,245
You're not an ordinary person.

737
01:10:49,454 --> 01:10:50,789
You can't kill Mr. Tan.

738
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:55,251
A'gou, you are in no position to
talk to me like that.

739
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:58,088
You're planning to kill him tomorrow.

740
01:10:59,714 --> 01:11:01,549
Because while he pretends to form an
alliance with you,

741
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,594
he has already notified
the imperial court to be prepared.

742
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,847
Your spy in the imperial court,

743
01:11:08,223 --> 01:11:10,350
has already got ahold of his file.

744
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:15,188
Are you a fortune-teller?

745
01:11:17,399 --> 01:11:18,692
You study Tui Bei Tu (Poems of Prophecy)?

746
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:21,152
Zi Wei Dou Shu (Astrology of Fate)?

747
01:11:21,194 --> 01:11:22,737
Or have you foreseen
the mystery of the future?

748
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:43,925
I'm from the future.

749
01:11:43,967 --> 01:11:47,178
In other words, I came back from tomorrow.

750
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:50,390
I know what you are going to do tomorrow.

751
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:54,519
But I'm warning you,
you'd better not do it.

752
01:12:05,613 --> 01:12:06,698
Fine.

753
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:12,120
I promise you. I'll follow my heart.

754
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:15,290
I won't do anything against my conscious.

755
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:51,553
I have gone to warn the Commander.
He won't dare kill Mr. Tan.

756
01:13:52,262 --> 01:13:53,555
The history will be changed.

757
01:13:53,596 --> 01:13:57,016
Maybe you and Director Tiger Chen can
finally be together in the future.

758
01:15:12,592 --> 01:15:13,635
He's gone.

759
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:18,139
I stimulated your deepest consciousness
and pushed him out.

760
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:23,770
And what you said earlier?

761
01:15:25,063 --> 01:15:28,524
You mean your love with
Director Tiger Chen...

762
01:15:28,733 --> 01:15:31,194
or...I love you?

763
01:15:32,862 --> 01:15:35,365
You perverted robot!

764
01:15:43,373 --> 01:15:45,792
Did you really go warn the Commander?

765
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:51,130
Then...will the history really be changed?

766
01:15:51,881 --> 01:15:54,092
If Mr. Tan doesn't die...

767
01:15:55,426 --> 01:15:57,637
at a quarter to one tomorrow,

768
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:02,225
we will be sacrificed and disappear.

769
01:16:40,263 --> 01:16:44,267
In just a little while, the history will
be changed if the Commander...

770
01:16:45,184 --> 01:16:46,519
doesn't kill Mr. Tan.

771
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:52,191
And we will...disappear
from this point in time.

772
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:55,403
We'll disappear from the world.

773
01:16:58,114 --> 01:17:02,035
Will that be like
the Butterfly Lovers?

774
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:06,456
It's said that nothing was in their tombs
when people dug them out.

775
01:17:07,081 --> 01:17:09,459
They turned into butterflies and
flew away.

776
01:17:11,002 --> 01:17:12,503
Why are you laughing?

777
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:17,342
I do prefer this version of you.

778
01:17:41,949 --> 01:17:43,951
We didn't disappear.

779
01:17:44,535 --> 01:17:46,954
Commander killed Mr. Tan?

780
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:57,840
I had a chance to escort Mr. Tan,

781
01:17:59,050 --> 01:18:01,427
but he didn't want me to.

782
01:18:03,471 --> 01:18:06,182
He said he was willing to sacrifice
his own life...

783
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,231
so others would realize
the importance of peace.

784
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:17,026
I smile at the sky as I die under
the sword.

785
01:18:17,568 --> 01:18:19,779
I will go, leaving my soul to linger
in this world.

786
01:18:20,196 --> 01:18:23,032
He sacrificed his life for the sake
of the country.

787
01:18:27,912 --> 01:18:30,206
Since you're leaving to travel the
country,

788
01:18:30,748 --> 01:18:32,750
could you do me a favor?

789
01:18:35,378 --> 01:18:38,548
Would you deliver this to the Great Wall?

790
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:46,514
What are you going to do?

791
01:18:46,556 --> 01:18:48,391
I'm going to ask the Commander...

792
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:53,396
why he killed Mr. Tan knowing what's
going to happen in the future.

793
01:18:55,189 --> 01:18:56,566
There's no need for you to ask.

794
01:18:57,567 --> 01:19:00,778
Maybe...it's impossible for us
to change the history.

795
01:19:01,696 --> 01:19:04,949
Maybe...Commander was possessed.

796
01:19:05,366 --> 01:19:08,411
It may be a trap for you to go to him now.

797
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,330
It has been a while so
my electromagnetic gun...

798
01:19:11,372 --> 01:19:13,249
has lost its power.

799
01:19:15,209 --> 01:19:18,588
My body is an electromagnetic gun.

800
01:19:19,172 --> 01:19:22,091
No way. Don't forget the Three Rules
for Robots.

801
01:19:22,592 --> 01:19:24,010
You can't kill a human.

802
01:19:24,343 --> 01:19:28,598
Besides, even if you're able to force
the alien out of him...

803
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:32,101
I won't allow it. This is an order.

804
01:19:33,769 --> 01:19:34,937
Don't act rashly.

805
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,190
Give me some time to figure it out.

806
01:20:15,019 --> 01:20:19,815
Cuckoo is an extraordinary woman
I recruited from Russia.

807
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:23,444
She started her practice of
multi-style...

808
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:25,279
integrated martial arts since childhood.

809
01:20:25,655 --> 01:20:27,365
She has mastered her leg skills...

810
01:20:27,406 --> 01:20:30,076
to the level of professional proficiency.

811
01:22:40,498 --> 01:22:42,750
The world is diverse,
tolerance is a virtue.

812
01:23:06,482 --> 01:23:09,610
Warning!
First rule for Robots, do not harm humans.

813
01:23:23,833 --> 01:23:25,334
I'm curious...

814
01:23:25,793 --> 01:23:29,338
why did you do it even after knowing who
I really am.

815
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:37,722
I wouldn't be who I am if I get
easily scared...

816
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:41,142
just because of a few things people said.

817
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:44,395
Then it's time for you to accept
the punishment!

818
01:23:44,687 --> 01:23:46,689
Oh, really?

819
01:23:48,441 --> 01:23:52,862
Let's see...how capable you are.

820
01:24:05,916 --> 01:24:07,668
...how capable you are.

821
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:08,878
A'gou.

822
01:25:03,766 --> 01:25:06,519
How could you be willing to let
it control you?

823
01:25:06,769 --> 01:25:08,896
It will destroy the earth
in the future.

824
01:25:08,938 --> 01:25:12,233
Every inch of the land under your feet
will turn into a sea of fire.

825
01:25:13,108 --> 01:25:15,861
It's so far away from now.
It's none of my business.

826
01:25:16,946 --> 01:25:20,825
What I know now is that
I will be successful...

827
01:25:20,866 --> 01:25:22,910
and the world will soon be mine.

828
01:25:26,205 --> 01:25:29,750
Are you sure? Why would it come out once
it possessed you?

829
01:25:31,710 --> 01:25:35,089
You can't kill me.
I will never die nor perish.

830
01:25:35,756 --> 01:25:38,759
I will forever exist on this planet.

831
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:45,516
And you...every one of you will be turned
into a killing machine.

832
01:25:46,016 --> 01:25:49,937
I will make humans destroy each other.

833
01:26:08,247 --> 01:26:09,999
You can't destroy me.

834
01:26:51,290 --> 01:26:52,666
What are you doing?

835
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:54,752
You will die
when you run out of battery.

836
01:27:18,692 --> 01:27:20,027
A'gou.

837
01:27:51,058 --> 01:27:53,894
Why are you here?

838
01:27:54,395 --> 01:27:56,105
What happened?

839
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:02,903
What happened to me?
Where is A'gou?

840
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:07,783
A'gou?

841
01:28:09,368 --> 01:28:10,619
A'gou...

842
01:28:18,836 --> 01:28:20,254
What happened?

843
01:28:37,312 --> 01:28:38,772
Commander.

844
01:28:41,859 --> 01:28:42,943
Commander.

845
01:28:42,985 --> 01:28:44,903
Issue an order...

846
01:28:45,571 --> 01:28:48,157
to stop dispatching our men and...

847
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:50,492
withdraw the whole troop.

848
01:28:51,869 --> 01:28:53,120
Yes, sir.

849
01:28:54,788 --> 01:28:57,041
What happened here today...

850
01:28:58,459 --> 01:29:01,420
will remained classified. No one's
allowed to talk about it, not even a word.

851
01:29:04,173 --> 01:29:05,382
If anyone...

852
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:06,884
I will make them disappear.

853
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:24,735
Find someone
to write a biography for him.

854
01:29:25,611 --> 01:29:27,613
Let him be known.

855
01:29:27,946 --> 01:29:31,366
If A'gou could know Commander's kindness,

856
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:33,327
he would be grateful.

857
01:29:33,368 --> 01:29:35,788
I will arrange someone
to write a biography for him.

858
01:29:55,682 --> 01:29:59,394
The King of Northern Leg

859
01:31:14,303 --> 01:31:17,264
Loading...Northern Leg
