- Uh, well, a Kim Sweet.

332
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:52,452
It's nice to meet you.

333
00:19:52,539 --> 00:19:53,366
- Pleasure.

334
00:19:54,497 --> 00:19:55,759
I'll talk to you later, Trent.

335
00:19:55,846 --> 00:19:56,760
- Thank you, Sandy.

336
00:20:00,111 --> 00:20:03,985
Uh, the Kim Sweet?

337
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:04,899
- Yeah.

338
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,815
[laughs] I kinda had this, like,

339
00:20:07,902 --> 00:20:10,252
itty bitty pop music career,
like, a million years ago

340
00:20:10,339 --> 00:20:11,471
but it's not important.

341
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:12,733
We don't have to talk about it.

342
00:20:14,387 --> 00:20:15,953
- Okay.

343
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,520
Maybe some other time.

344
00:20:17,607 --> 00:20:18,434
- [Kim] Yeah.

345
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,482
- You know, for now
I would concentrate

346
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:24,440
on how many more deformed
frogs you can find

347
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:27,051
on your property and look
for signs of pollution.

348
00:20:28,183 --> 00:20:32,187
- Like fast food
wrappers or chemicals?

349
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:34,058
- Chemicals.

350
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:39,020
- But since this kind of
thing only happens to animals

351
00:20:39,107 --> 00:20:41,544
that live near the
water, we're good.

352
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:47,724
- Kim, we are animals
that live near the water.

353
00:21:11,182 --> 00:21:12,096
- Can we go swimming?

354
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:13,010
This is boring.

355
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:15,665
- Oh, damn, boy.

356
00:21:15,752 --> 00:21:16,623
Give it a chance.

357
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:21,280
Besides, this water might
be bad for swimming.

358
00:21:21,367 --> 00:21:23,282
I want you to stay
out of it, you hear?

359
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,373
- Then why are we--

360
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,462
- Being on it and being in
it are two different things.

361
00:21:34,641 --> 00:21:36,469
- So it's safe to
eat fish from here?

362
00:21:37,905 --> 00:21:40,168
- Oh, you don't catch no
fish in this lake anyway.

363
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:43,302
- Then why are we fishing?

364
00:21:45,478 --> 00:21:49,699
- It's not about the fish,
it's about the experience.

365
00:21:49,786 --> 00:21:52,093
- Experience of
not catching fish.

366
00:21:55,618 --> 00:21:57,446
- [laughs] You'll understand
when you get older.

367
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:05,106
Uh, what did you and
your friends do for fun?

368
00:22:07,021 --> 00:22:09,806
- Comic books,
skateboarding, online gaming.

369
00:22:13,462 --> 00:22:16,073
- Yeah, we might not have
much of that around here

370
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,642
but we got each other.

371
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:20,861
We got family.

372
00:22:21,949 --> 00:22:23,342
That's what it's all about.

373
00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,083
We take care of each
other no matter what.

374
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,477
So, what do you want
to be when you grow up?

375
00:22:28,564 --> 00:22:29,391
Aw!

376
00:22:29,478 --> 00:22:30,914
Friggin' son of a...

377
00:22:31,872 --> 00:22:33,221
Look at that.

378
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:35,354
Made in China bull crap.

379
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:37,225
Well...

380
00:22:49,672 --> 00:22:52,632
- So what do you think about
those people disappearing?

381
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:55,461
- Well, that all happened
an hour or two north of here

382
00:22:55,548 --> 00:22:57,550
so it's nothing you
need to worry about.

383
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:05,558
- There was a kid who
went missing about my age.

384
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,342
Think they'll find him?

385
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:08,778
- I'm sure they will.

386
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:26,230
No, it's yours.

387
00:23:27,623 --> 00:23:28,450
- Seriously?

388
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:31,627
Wow, thanks, Chuck.

389
00:23:35,326 --> 00:23:37,111
- Always comes in handy.

390
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,941
Yeah, I guess we
could head back.

391

Hey, do me a favor, huh?

394
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,456
Don't tell your mom.

395
00:24:19,196 --> 00:24:21,329
I don't want her to think
it's any worse than it is.

396
00:24:23,331 --> 00:24:25,333
- Uh, do you want me to...

397
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,421
- No, no, no, no.

398
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,335
I got it.

399
00:24:31,557 --> 00:24:33,559
- What, you don't like
boats with motors?

400
00:24:34,516 --> 00:24:35,778
- [scoffs] I am the motor.

401
00:24:37,911 --> 00:24:38,694
Ready?

402
00:24:39,695 --> 00:24:40,522
Varoom.

403
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,661
- You really think
we're gonna find more

404
00:24:48,748 --> 00:24:49,662
of these mutant things?

405
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:53,666
- The kids keep calling me
to find out what happened.

406
00:24:57,104 --> 00:24:59,889
Mr. Douglas said it would be
a huge help if I found more.

407
00:25:01,543 --> 00:25:02,370
- Okey dokey.

[splashes]

409
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:06,722
- [Eva] What are you doing?

410
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:09,420
- If you want to catch a frog,
you gotta think like a frog.

411
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:10,857
Ribbit!

412
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:11,945
- I appreciate that
but just so you know,

413
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:13,163
I won't be joining you.

414
00:25:15,601 --> 00:25:16,689
- Come on, give me a hand.

415
00:25:19,692 --> 00:25:21,607
[laughs]

416
00:25:21,694 --> 00:25:22,521
Oh, shit.

Oh, crap.

418
00:25:24,174 --> 00:25:25,698
- My savior!

419
00:25:25,785 --> 00:25:26,612
Ugh.

420
00:25:26,699 --> 00:25:27,743
- Oh, gosh.

421
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,918
Ugh.

422
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,529
Oh, crap.

423
00:25:30,616 --> 00:25:32,095
- [Eva] What?

424
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,793
- I think I lost my
shoe. [ominous music]

425
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,881
- Well, come on.

426
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,186
- I'm actually kind of stuck.

427
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:37,100
- Whatever.

428
00:25:38,145 --> 00:25:39,015
- Seriously.

00:25:39,102 --> 00:25:39,886
- [Eva] Well, whatever.

430
00:25:39,973 --> 00:25:41,235
You're on your own.

431
00:25:41,322 --> 00:25:41,888

think I'm kind of...

- Uh, nature.

437
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:57,425
Just nature.

Grand Rapids officials
report no new leads

for 34-year-old Tina Stevens

who was last seen
heading to Black Lake

to photograph wildlife
two weeks ago.

You see how close we are to
all of these farms, right?

468
00:27:38,918 --> 00:27:40,397
Well, they spray all these
farms with pesticides,

herbicides, that sort of thing.

So?

472
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,665

overspray leaks into the lakes

473
00:27:46,752 --> 00:27:48,754
and the ponds and then bam!

- Well, let's go ask 'em.

is owned by Larry Rogers

00:28:35,191 --> 00:28:36,453
- Do we have to
use boiled water?

497
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,977
After a few minutes,
it's freezing.

498
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:41,023
- Well, it's a clean,
safe shower, isn't it?

499
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,155
- I don't know.

500
00:28:42,242 --> 00:28:42,764
Are these more winter toilets?

501
00:28:43,809 --> 00:28:44,635
- Ugh.

502
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,985
- Oh, jeez, you guys.

503
00:28:46,072 --> 00:28:47,029
Shh, shh.

504
00:28:47,116 --> 00:28:48,248
- People need to be aware.

505
00:28:49,118 --> 00:28:50,859
Look out for your neighbors.

506
00:28:50,946 --> 00:28:52,687
Authorities in
International Falls

507
00:28:52,774 --> 00:28:55,821
and Grand Rapids believe
these are kidnappings

508
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:59,259
and quite possibly related
to human trafficking.

509
00:28:59,346 --> 00:29:01,043
- The Mayor is still
encouraging people to...

510
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,088
- Hey, Chuck?

511
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,002
What's with the neighbors?

512
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:03,742
- [Chuck] Neighbors?

513
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:04,612
- Neighbors?

514
00:29:04,699 --> 00:29:05,569
We have neighbors?

515
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:06,788
- Yeah, across the lake.

516
00:29:06,875 --> 00:29:07,963
That little deformed
girl with her dad.

517
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:08,921
- Okay.

518
00:29:09,008 --> 00:29:10,836
Look, now, both of you.

519
00:29:10,923 --> 00:29:13,403
You stay clear of
them all together.

520
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,796
- Christ, you're
practically a hermit.

521
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,537
Who do you want to
be associated with?

522
00:29:16,624 --> 00:29:19,583
- Look, there've
been some bad rumors.

523
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:21,368
- Seems safe with
the little girl.

524
00:29:21,455 --> 00:29:23,283
- Just stay away from them.

525
00:29:23,370 --> 00:29:26,286
If good fences make
good neighbors,

526
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:28,549
then a whole lake
makes even better ones.

527
00:29:32,945 --> 00:29:34,555
- No.

528
00:29:34,642 --> 00:29:36,513
I should go with you, Kim,
I'm the science teacher.

529
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,254
- No.

530
00:29:38,341 --> 00:29:39,560
Not gonna happen. He doesn't
even want to go with me.

531
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,823
I just need to know
what to look for.

532
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:43,216
- Okay.

533
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,740
If it has anything to
do with pesticides,

534
00:29:45,827 --> 00:29:48,351
it would probably
involve Chloroprene.

535
00:29:48,438 --> 00:29:50,876
Chloroprene contains
synthetic retinoids.

536
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:52,660
That's a derivative
of Vitamin A.

537
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:57,534
- And that's the shit
that mutates the frogs?

538
00:29:57,621 --> 00:30:00,189
- Retinoids have been known
to cause severe birth defects,

539
00:30:01,451 --> 00:30:03,149
including limb malformation.

540
00:30:05,281 --> 00:30:07,240
- Limb malformation?

541
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:09,590
[knocking]

542
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:17,032
[door squeaks]

543
00:30:17,119 --> 00:30:18,860
- Oh, heya, Chuck.

544
00:30:18,947 --> 00:30:20,166
- Heya, Larry.

545
00:30:20,253 --> 00:30:21,297
- How ya doing?

546
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:22,516
- Hey.

547
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:23,996
Kim.

548
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:25,911
- Oh, yeah, hey.

549
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:26,825
Sweet.

550
00:30:28,565 --> 00:30:31,438
- Yeah, Kim's son's doing
a school report on farming

551
00:30:31,525 --> 00:30:35,094
and we were wondering if
you could show us what kind

552
00:30:35,181 --> 00:30:36,660
of pesticide you're spraying?

553
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:39,446
- What is this, Chuck?

554
00:30:41,578 --> 00:30:43,798
- Look, she's living with me
now and with her young son.

555
00:30:43,885 --> 00:30:45,931
And she's concerned about safety

556
00:30:46,018 --> 00:30:48,324
with the pesticides
being used in the area.

557
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:53,112
- Well, DDT was the nasty stuff

558
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:56,332
but they, you know, they
banned that back in the 70s.

559
00:30:56,419 --> 00:30:58,944
I only use organic shit
from American Patriot.

560
00:30:59,031 --> 00:31:00,467
Well, not shit
literally but, you know.

561
00:31:00,554 --> 00:31:01,816
- Right, I got it.

562
00:31:01,903 --> 00:31:03,383
Can I just see the containers?

563
00:31:04,384 --> 00:31:05,689
- What?

564
00:31:05,776 --> 00:31:07,996
- Uh, what could be
the harm, you know,

565
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,998
just to put her mind at ease?

566
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:13,219
- My word should be good
enough for you, Chuck.

567
00:31:14,394 --> 00:31:15,743
- Good enough for the EPA?

568
00:31:23,098 --> 00:31:24,491
- I'm telling you, guys,
this is a waste of time.

569
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:25,971
I ain't got nothing to hide.

570
00:31:26,058 --> 00:31:28,277
- Yeah? Then why don't
you show it to us?

571
00:31:29,409 --> 00:31:31,019
- Come on, Chuck.

572
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,499
How long we been neighbors?

573
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:34,501
Can't you at least come
back a little later?

574
00:31:34,588 --> 00:31:36,111
I'm right in the
middle of something.

575
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:37,199
- You could just
show us right quick.

576
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:38,592
We'll be out of your hair.

577
00:31:42,248 --> 00:31:43,162
- [sighs] Fine.

578
00:31:43,249 --> 00:31:44,163
Wait.

579
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,512
Wait here.

580
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,339
I'll be right back.

581
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:47,993
Wait.

582
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,863
Wait here.

583
00:31:50,386 --> 00:31:51,257
- This is bullshit.

584
00:31:51,344 --> 00:31:52,345
He's hiding something.

585
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,912
- No, Kim, don't--

586
00:31:57,089 --> 00:31:59,613
[banjo music]

587
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:09,362
[laughs]

588
00:32:09,449 --> 00:32:10,537
- Holy crap.

589
00:32:11,625 --> 00:32:13,670
You people actually exist?

590
00:32:13,757 --> 00:32:16,804
- It's, it's not, I don't...

591
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,023
Don't judge.

592
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,851
We're all consenting adults.

593
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,942
- Yeah, no, it's, uh, oh.

594
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:26,770
- No, that's just a friend.

595
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:30,557
You know a thousand kids
is killed every year

596
00:32:30,644 --> 00:32:32,298
by household cleaning products.

597
00:32:32,385 --> 00:32:34,996
Why don't you go
harass those companies?

598
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,911
- American Patriot Chemicals.

599
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:38,304
All organic.

600
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:41,133
No Chloroprene.

601
00:32:43,309 --> 00:32:46,573
- Well, uh, let's go, Kim.

602
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:48,053
Sorry about this, Larry.

603
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,967
- Yeah.

604
00:32:50,490 --> 00:32:52,448
Well, you know, while
you're here, you guys,

605
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:54,320
you want to try something on?

606
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,192
- Are you fucking nuts?

607
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,063
- Okay!

608
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,455
We'll be going.

609
00:32:59,542 --> 00:33:00,239
- Wait, wait, no,
wait, wait, wait.

610
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:01,849
Wait a minute.

611
00:33:01,936 --> 00:33:04,243
Hey, is, is this all
about them mutated frogs?

612
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:05,157
- Yeah.

613
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,986
You seen 'em?

614
00:33:08,073 --> 00:33:11,424
- Yeah, I seen about, oh,
five, last couple days.

615
00:33:11,511 --> 00:33:12,294
- Where?

616
00:33:18,692 --> 00:33:19,823
- What are you doing?

617
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,652
- Oh, uh, looking for frogs.

618
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:28,397
So you live across
the lake, huh?

619
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:29,485
- Yeah, with my dad.

620
00:33:32,532 --> 00:33:33,402
- Wanna help?

621
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:34,316
- Sure.

622
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:35,622
Want me to hold that?

623
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:36,666
- Yeah, thanks.

624
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:40,409
We're looking for any
frogs that are deformed.

625
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,632
You know, frogs with
extra or missing legs.

626
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,589
- How come?

627
00:33:48,113 --> 00:33:49,331
- Well, someone should be.

628
00:33:49,418 --> 00:33:52,030
Plus I think they're
kind of cool.

629
00:33:55,903 --> 00:33:57,470
Sorry about the kids at school.

630
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:59,167
Total pricks.

631
00:33:59,254 --> 00:33:59,994
- It's okay.

632
00:34:00,081 --> 00:34:00,864
I'm used to it.

633
00:34:02,388 --> 00:34:03,215
- You think this water
could've done something

634
00:34:03,302 --> 00:34:04,825
to you and your dad?

635
00:34:04,912 --> 00:34:08,133
- My dad was born like
that, in New Jersey.

636
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,047
Not here.

637
00:34:11,223 --> 00:34:13,660
- [Brody] Are there always
so many snails out here?

638
00:34:14,878 --> 00:34:17,577
- So, Larry's working
on the ATV on a hill.

639
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,146
Doesn't put it in gear,
rolls right into the lake.

640
00:34:21,233 --> 00:34:22,016
- Oh.

641
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:22,843
- [Man] Again?

642
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:23,757
- Again.

643
00:34:27,152 --> 00:34:28,588
- Can I take that down?

644
00:34:28,675 --> 00:34:30,155
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

645
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,939
That must have happened tonight.

646
00:34:33,593 --> 00:34:35,508
Don't worry, Kim, you'll
win 'em over eventually.

647
00:34:35,595 --> 00:34:37,466
[rips]

648
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:44,256
- Another exciting
Shirley Temple, please.

649
00:34:44,343 --> 00:34:46,606
- [Woman] Oh, for the
mother to be, anything.

650
00:34:47,781 --> 00:34:49,087
- The search continues
near Hawksridge Park

651
00:34:49,174 --> 00:34:50,175
for 18-year-old Eva Johnson...

652
00:34:50,262 --> 00:34:51,915
- Hey.

653
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,526
- And 19-year-old Derek
Novitzki who have been missing

654
00:34:53,613 --> 00:34:55,005
for four days now.

655
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,443
Three days ago, Eva
Johnson's car was found

656
00:34:57,530 --> 00:34:59,880
in the parking lot of
Birchwood Elementary.

657
00:35:01,229 --> 00:35:02,970
- At this point we're
considering the disappearances

658
00:35:03,057 --> 00:35:04,798
to be tied into the
potential kidnappings

659
00:35:04,885 --> 00:35:07,366
that occurred in International
Falls and Grand Rapids.

660
00:35:07,453 --> 00:35:09,890
- Oh, sick bastards.

661
00:35:09,977 --> 00:35:11,196
- See?

662
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,632
That's what I'm afraid of, Kim.

663
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,329
Not frogs.

664
00:35:14,416 --> 00:35:17,071
- But it all started
happening about the same time.

665
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:18,638
- Well, it was probably
the pesticides.

666
00:35:18,725 --> 00:35:19,595
I mean, you don't know
what the hell they put

667
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:20,640
in the water these days.

668
00:35:20,727 --> 00:35:21,771
- No, hey, hey, don't, stop.

669
00:35:21,858 --> 00:35:23,121
Don't talk shit about something

670
00:35:23,208 --> 00:35:25,340
you don't know
anything about, okay?

671
00:35:25,427 --> 00:35:27,255
American Patriot's
been good to us.

672
00:35:27,342 --> 00:35:28,691
- You're drunk.

673
00:35:28,778 --> 00:35:30,345
- And that's what
keeps this town going.

674
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,085
- Hey, Greg, what were
you and Sam talking about

675
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:31,955
the other day?

676
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,000
- Oh, here we go.

677
00:35:33,087 --> 00:35:34,784
- No, no, Judy, this is...

678
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:37,091
There's this disfigured father
living with his daughter

679
00:35:37,178 --> 00:35:38,745
right across the lake
from Chuck and Sam.

680
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:39,876
- Oh, right, right.

681
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:41,574
That's that Joe Shit the ragman.

682
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,315
I mean, he's the father.

683
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:46,187
- Him and that nasty girl
bathing right in the lake.

684
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,407
- And?

685
00:35:48,494 --> 00:35:49,408
- And?

686
00:35:49,495 --> 00:35:50,322
It's fucking gross.

687
00:35:50,409 --> 00:35:51,932
And it's dangerous.

688
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:52,846
See this?

689
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:58,243
We got into it real heavy on a
job site a couple years back.

690
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:01,159
He said he'd scar the whole
town if he could find a way.

691
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:02,247
Maybe he found a way.

692
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:04,988
Who knows how those
people got kidnapped

693
00:36:05,075 --> 00:36:08,775
but if you ask me,
that freak did it.

694
00:36:08,862 --> 00:36:10,342
- [Woman] Oh, Sam, you're drunk.

695
00:36:10,429 --> 00:36:12,257
- [Sam] We got a monster
living across the lake.

696
00:36:12,344 --> 00:36:14,781
- [Man] Take it
easy, take it easy.

697
00:36:14,868 --> 00:36:16,261
- [Sam] Someone's
gotta do something.

698
00:36:16,348 --> 00:36:17,175
- [Man] Alright.

699
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:25,095
[phone ringing]

700
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,009
- Yeah, Edna.

701
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,404
Well, no, no, I
lost track of time

702
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:31,014
but she's still waiting there?

703
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:32,799
My gosh.

704
00:36:32,886 --> 00:36:33,756
Uh, send her in.

705
00:36:33,843 --> 00:36:35,454
Send her in right away.

706
00:36:35,541 --> 00:36:36,368
Sorry.

707
00:36:39,414 --> 00:36:41,416
[sighs]

708
00:36:43,505 --> 00:36:46,291
Miss Sweet, so sorry to,
uh, keep you waiting.

709
00:36:46,378 --> 00:36:47,553
Please have a seat.

710
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,597
- Thank you for seeing me.

711
00:36:48,684 --> 00:36:49,642
- Of course.

712
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:50,730
My pleasure.

713
00:36:50,817 --> 00:36:52,166
It's been a, been a busy day

714
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:54,255
but they're all busy
days, aren't they?

715
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:57,650
Yeah, now you are
somewhere here.

716
00:36:57,737 --> 00:36:59,173
I will find you.

717
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,696
Here.

718
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,089
Right.

719
00:37:02,176 --> 00:37:05,788
You have been making
some discoveries?

720
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,664
- Yes, um, Mr.
Mayor, I'm a mother.

721
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:16,016
I have a kid and
there's other mothers...

722
00:37:16,103 --> 00:37:17,496
- Deformed frogs?

723
00:37:17,583 --> 00:37:20,325
Miss Sweet, you found
some deformed frogs.

724
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:21,239
That's it?

725
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:24,242
- Yes.

726
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:28,115
Um, and just because we
don't know of any ways

727
00:37:28,202 --> 00:37:30,857
in which it's affected humans
doesn't mean it hasn't.

728
00:37:32,162 --> 00:37:33,990
- Well, that's true that, uh,

729
00:37:35,383 --> 00:37:38,647
that is a legitimate concern
and I understand that.

730
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,215
[sighs]

731
00:37:41,302 --> 00:37:42,956
But I'm sure you'll
understand that right now

732
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:45,915
my primary concern is finding
those missing teenagers.

733
00:37:49,049 --> 00:37:50,137
- Can't we do both?

734
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:00,452
- Miss Sweet, this city
used to have a top rank

735
00:38:02,062 --> 00:38:05,587
in the entire country as
a place to raise children.

736
00:38:07,937 --> 00:38:10,462
- So don't you want
to tell people, like,

737
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:15,075
stay out of the water or don't
eat local fish or something?

738
00:38:15,162 --> 00:38:17,947
I mean, what if it turns out
to be pesticide pollution?

739
00:38:22,387 --> 00:38:23,910
- Now why would you say that?

740
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:28,610
- Well, just 'cause the
local pesticides are organic,

741
00:38:28,697 --> 00:38:32,658
does that mean they're safe
or they just sound safe?

742
00:38:34,486 --> 00:38:36,575
- Miss Sweet, I'm going
to ask you a question

743
00:38:36,662 --> 00:38:41,319
and please, I'd like you to
try to answer it honestly.

744
00:38:47,586 --> 00:38:49,283
In any part of
this are you trying

745
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,764
to regain publicity
for yourself?

746
00:38:53,505 --> 00:38:55,333
- You think making
a bunch of noise

747
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:58,727
about mutant frogs is gonna
reignite my pop career?

748
00:38:58,814 --> 00:39:00,468
- No.

749
00:39:00,555 --> 00:39:03,166
I'm just telling you what
other people might think.

750
00:39:03,253 --> 00:39:06,169
American Patriot Chemicals
have already been tested

751
00:39:06,256 --> 00:39:09,042
and approved by the EPA.

752
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:11,087
That's a big deal.

753
00:39:12,872 --> 00:39:15,962
- Well, did they test it on
wildlife during fetal stages?

754
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:19,052
- Farms in Northern
Minnesota are already using

755
00:39:19,139 --> 00:39:21,228
their pesticides,
their fertilizers.

756
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:22,925
They love them.

757
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:25,754
Local farms here have started
using them this spring

758
00:39:25,841 --> 00:39:27,408
to great success
and now we're going

759
00:39:27,495 --> 00:39:29,671
to start rolling them out
to surrounding states.

760
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,151
It's a success story.

761
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:34,459
- What if it hurts people?
Could you live with yourself?

762
00:39:34,546 --> 00:39:37,157
- Half of this state
is agricultural land.

763
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:39,202
If you kick start
a premature scare,

764
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,117
those farm families starve.

765
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:42,815
And could you live
with yourself?

766
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,645
- God, you're like
some movie mayor.

767
00:39:50,518 --> 00:39:53,608
Mr. Mayor, my dad's
property is in the middle

768
00:39:53,695 --> 00:39:55,436
of a bunch of these farms

769
00:39:55,523 --> 00:39:57,090
and on one of those farms they
found a ton of these frogs.

770
00:39:57,177 --> 00:39:59,397
Do you think that's
a coincidence?

771
00:40:00,572 --> 00:40:02,574
- And your science
degree is in what?

772
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:11,409
- I'm working with a
local science teacher.

773
00:40:12,758 --> 00:40:13,628
- Uh huh.

774
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:14,455
And who would that be?

775
00:40:16,065 --> 00:40:20,461
- Trent Douglas at Birchwood.

776
00:40:22,332 --> 00:40:23,464
- Elementary School?

777
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:25,423
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

778
00:40:28,338 --> 00:40:29,296
Tell you what, Kim.

779
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:35,215
Somebody bring me
some solid evidence

780
00:40:35,302 --> 00:40:38,131
that connects deformities
and the pesticides

781
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,698
and I will take action.

782
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:41,656
I promise you.

783
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:46,618
Uh, you know, American
Patriot Chemicals

784
00:40:48,141 --> 00:40:49,882
is the biggest job
provider in the city

785
00:40:49,969 --> 00:40:51,405
and they pay a lot of taxes

786
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:53,320
so I'm not gonna cause
any trouble for them

787
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,888
without any probable cause.

788
00:40:55,975 --> 00:40:56,758
You understand?

789
00:40:57,759 --> 00:40:58,543
- Right.

790
00:40:58,630 --> 00:40:59,587
- Right.

791
00:40:59,674 --> 00:41:01,154
Thank you for dropping by.

792
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:02,416
- Thank you.

793
00:41:02,503 --> 00:41:03,330
- Yes.

794
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:08,335
[whistles]

795
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:29,443
[slow music]

796
00:41:48,723 --> 00:41:50,159
- Hi.

797
00:41:50,246 --> 00:41:51,944
I would like to speak
to a reporter, please.

798
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:54,860
- Okay, if I can just
get your name and number

799
00:41:54,947 --> 00:41:56,339
and what this is about,

800
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:57,906
I can make sure that
someone will contact you

801
00:41:57,993 --> 00:41:59,473
if they feel it's newsworthy.

802
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,953
- Okay.

803
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,608
I've been finding these
deformed frogs, see?

804
00:42:03,695 --> 00:42:05,610
On my dad's property
and farms around there.

805
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,742
- I know who you are.

806
00:42:07,829 --> 00:42:09,527
We're not giving
you any attention.

807
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:16,490
- Look, I don't want
attention for me, I--

808
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:21,364
- War, bad economy,
no jobs, missing kids,

809
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:22,931
that's what people care about.

810
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:27,806
I was at your going
away party fundraiser.

811
00:42:27,893 --> 00:42:29,808
I donated $20.

812
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:32,462
Remember that?

813
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,204
And now you want us to put
you back in the spotlight?

814
00:42:36,423 --> 00:42:37,946
- No, I...

815
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:40,166
Look, see, this girl?

816
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:42,516
She's the one who found
the deformed frogs.

817
00:42:42,603 --> 00:42:44,823
- Oh, what a coincidence.

818
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:48,740
I guess you think I just
fell off the turnip truck.

819
00:42:48,827 --> 00:42:51,830
- Can you just do
your job, you know?

820
00:42:51,917 --> 00:42:54,093
Like just pick up the
phone and call somebody

821
00:42:54,180 --> 00:42:55,616
who's not a bitter old gash.

822
00:42:57,749 --> 00:42:58,576
- Security?

823
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:04,930
And get a haircut.

824
00:43:24,776 --> 00:43:27,605
- The baked meat.

825
00:43:29,215 --> 00:43:30,520
It's fantastic.

826
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,220
The maple syrup really makes it.

827
00:43:34,307 --> 00:43:35,351
- [Trent] Really?

828
00:43:35,438 --> 00:43:36,309
- [Kim] Oh, yeah.

829
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:39,617
- Thank you.

830
00:43:46,536 --> 00:43:50,192
- Do you think she
wants some more?

831
00:43:51,324 --> 00:43:52,717
- No, I think she's alright.

832
00:43:53,935 --> 00:43:55,807
Her appetite isn't
what it used to be.

833
00:43:57,025 --> 00:43:59,158
Dementia's really
caught up with her.

834
00:44:03,205 --> 00:44:04,032
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

835
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,209
How long has she been like that?

836
00:44:09,603 --> 00:44:11,257
- Oh, two years now.

837
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,086
It's tough.

838
00:44:14,173 --> 00:44:15,696
I wish I could do more for her.

839
00:44:17,176 --> 00:44:18,873
Can only afford to have
a home care nurse come by

840
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,485
like once a day and even
that's putting us in the hole.

841
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,622
- Well, I'm sure
she appreciates it.

842
00:44:31,016 --> 00:44:33,627
- I'll do whatever
I can for her.

843
00:44:33,714 --> 00:44:34,541
She's my mom.

844
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:41,766
You want to, uh, you want to
go in the other room and talk?

845
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,812
- Yeah.

846
00:44:44,899 --> 00:44:45,726
Sure.

847
00:44:46,901 --> 00:44:48,381
- Come on, Mom.

848
00:44:48,468 --> 00:44:49,948
Time to go to bed.

849
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:55,344
- Seven more of these
deformed frogs today.

850
00:44:55,431 --> 00:44:56,650
Just today.

851
00:44:56,737 --> 00:44:58,391
And a shit ton of snails.

852
00:44:58,478 --> 00:45:00,523
Or so Brody says.

853
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,481
- Did you say snails?

854
00:45:01,568 --> 00:45:02,961
- Yeah.

855
00:45:03,048 --> 00:45:05,703
A bunch of them all
around by the pond, why?

856
00:45:05,790 --> 00:45:08,401
- Snails can be major
carriers of parasites.

857
00:45:09,271 --> 00:45:10,229
- Parasites?

858
00:45:11,796 --> 00:45:13,667
Well, what brings
in all the snails?

859
00:45:14,886 --> 00:45:16,888
- Algae, plant growth.

860
00:45:19,804 --> 00:45:20,979
Why do you care so much?

861
00:45:22,415 --> 00:45:23,590
- Why wouldn't you care?

862
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,551
- You know, people
remember you around here.

863
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:31,816
You might be able
to get on the news.

864
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:33,643
- That won't work.

865
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:34,557
- Why?

866
00:45:36,995 --> 00:45:38,823
- [sighs] I had
a top 20 pop hit.

867
00:45:38,910 --> 00:45:41,216
And I thought I was a big deal.

868
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:43,436
Gave a bunch of interviews
about this place

869
00:45:44,306 --> 00:45:45,307
and slagged on it.

870
00:45:47,657 --> 00:45:49,529
These were good people.

871
00:45:49,616 --> 00:45:53,751
And they believed in
me and I flushed 'em.

872
00:45:57,189 --> 00:45:58,756
- [Trent] So then what happened?

873
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:02,716
- Well, right when we
were hitting the charts,

874
00:46:02,803 --> 00:46:04,196
this scandal came out.

875
00:46:07,939 --> 00:46:09,723
When I was recording the album,

876
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:13,553
the record company told me
that I had the right look

877
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,645
but, uh, they had somebody
better to cover the tracks.

878
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:20,560
So...

879
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:23,650
- So you didn't sing at all?

880
00:46:25,217 --> 00:46:26,044
- Nope.

881
00:46:28,829 --> 00:46:29,787
I wanted to.

882
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,531
I wanted to.

883
00:46:38,578 --> 00:46:39,797
- After that...

884
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,670
- Dropped off the
charts like a hot rock.

885
00:46:45,454 --> 00:46:47,108
Had a complete
nervous breakdown.

886
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:50,111
I bottomed out.

887
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:51,373
I'm lucky to be alive.

888
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,421
And that's when I
met Brody's dad.

889
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,642
He put me back together again.

890
00:47:02,297 --> 00:47:03,124
Saved me.

891
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,479
Anyway, I got a call from my dad

892
00:47:10,566 --> 00:47:13,395
that he's got liver cancer
so [laughs] here I am.

893
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:18,052
- What did they say
his outlook was?

894
00:47:18,139 --> 00:47:21,099
- A 15% survival
rate past five years

895
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:24,015
but with this surgery he's
got a fighting chance.

896
00:47:27,018 --> 00:47:30,064
- I think it took a lot
of guts coming back here.

897
00:47:30,151 --> 00:47:32,371
Taking care of
your dad like this.

898
00:47:33,372 --> 00:47:34,895
I do.

899
00:47:34,982 --> 00:47:35,809
- Really?

900
00:47:37,593 --> 00:47:39,857
I mean, it's not like I left
behind some fabulous life.

901
00:47:39,944 --> 00:47:40,858
- Doesn't matter.

902
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,730
You always have options, Kim.

903
00:47:45,819 --> 00:47:47,299
Don't forget that.

904
00:47:59,311 --> 00:48:01,400
- [Kim] What are my options now?

905
00:48:01,487 --> 00:48:02,705
- Um...

906
00:48:02,792 --> 00:48:03,619
I...

907
00:48:04,751 --> 00:48:06,057
I give a really good back rub.

908
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,799
I give a really
good foot rub too.

909
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:11,627
- Really?

910
00:48:21,681 --> 00:48:23,857
[kissing]

911
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:32,083
[flies buzzing]

912
00:49:18,129 --> 00:49:20,827
[ominous music]

913
00:49:25,049 --> 00:49:26,180
- Thanks, Mom.

914
00:49:27,268 --> 00:49:29,444
[gunshot]

915
00:49:31,403 --> 00:49:32,230
- Mom!

916
00:49:37,452 --> 00:49:38,410
- Dad!

917
00:49:38,497 --> 00:49:39,977
- Get him out of here!

918
00:49:40,064 --> 00:49:41,152
- What the hell are
you shooting at?

919
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:43,154
[whining]

920
00:49:43,241 --> 00:49:44,024
- [Brody] Mom.

921
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:44,982
- Wait.

922
00:49:45,069 --> 00:49:45,765
Dad, put the gun down.

923
00:49:45,852 --> 00:49:46,592
Where's Kinky?

924
00:49:47,767 --> 00:49:48,986
Brody!

925
00:49:49,073 --> 00:49:50,117
Brody!

926
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:52,206
- Brody, don't you touch that.

927
00:49:52,293 --> 00:49:53,077
- Brody!

928
00:49:53,164 --> 00:49:54,208
- Brody!

929
00:49:54,295 --> 00:49:57,081
You get the hell back here.

930
00:49:57,168 --> 00:49:59,387
[splashes]

931
00:50:09,093 --> 00:50:11,356
[screams]

932
00:50:15,186 --> 00:50:17,666
How about these dinners?

933
00:50:17,753 --> 00:50:19,886
Package even said
"deformity free".

934
00:50:25,370 --> 00:50:26,197
Nothing?

935
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:32,246
- Brody could have
gotten really hurt, Dad.

936
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,118
Why would you do
something like that?

937
00:50:34,205 --> 00:50:36,076
- You didn't see
them being born.

938
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:38,600
The way they were hurting Kinky.

939
00:50:38,687 --> 00:50:40,124
The way they might hurt us.

940
00:50:40,211 --> 00:50:40,994
- Hurt us?

941
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:44,041
- I don't know.

942
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:46,347
I was putting them out of their
misery, for crying out loud.

943
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,393
You think I like
killing puppies?

944
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,263
- Yes.

945
00:50:57,576 --> 00:50:59,795
[knocking]

946
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,060
- [Kim] You know,
this the first mammal

947
00:51:03,147 --> 00:51:04,322
we've seen like this.

948
00:51:07,499 --> 00:51:08,630
- What's wrong with it?

949
00:51:09,718 --> 00:51:10,937
- I'm trying to find out.

950
00:51:12,199 --> 00:51:13,505
Of course it would have helped

951
00:51:13,592 --> 00:51:16,334
if the rest of them
weren't in pieces.

952
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:20,381
- Is it even safe
for us to stay here?

953
00:51:20,468 --> 00:51:22,383
- We have no idea
whether it's related

954
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:24,864
to any kind of
chemical pollutant.

955
00:51:24,951 --> 00:51:26,518
- Well, what the hell
you think it is then?

956
00:51:26,605 --> 00:51:27,475
X-Men?

957
00:51:29,129 --> 00:51:31,523
Ah, didn't think I knew
about them, did ya?

958
00:51:35,614 --> 00:51:37,703
[groans]

959
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:40,749
- [Kim] Brody, don't touch it.

960
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,493
- Truth is to this
day we don't even know

961
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:47,278
what causes most
human birth defects.

962
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:49,584
You mentioned
something the other day

963
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:51,238
about finding a bunch of snails.

964
00:51:51,325 --> 00:51:52,152
- Yeah, a ton.

965
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,588
- There's been cases

966
00:51:53,675 --> 00:51:56,156
where parasitic worm
life cycles launch

967
00:51:56,243 --> 00:51:58,202
using a snail as a host.

968
00:51:58,289 --> 00:52:00,334
See, the snail carries
'em down to the water

969
00:52:00,421 --> 00:52:02,902
where they run loose and
invade another species,

970
00:52:02,989 --> 00:52:03,990
like a tadpole.

971
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:08,081
See, they burrow into the
tadpole right at the limb buds,

972
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:10,301
deliberately screwing
up the development,

973
00:52:10,388 --> 00:52:12,607
causing missing or extra limbs.

974
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:14,653
- Why would a parasite do that?

975
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:16,829
- When the tadpole
matures into a frog,

976
00:52:16,916 --> 00:52:19,875
it's handicapped so it's
easy prey for birds.

977
00:52:21,181 --> 00:52:22,965
The bird easily swoops
down, picks up the frog,

978
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:24,184
eats it, digests it.

979
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:28,536
The parasite can then spawn
more larvae in the bird feces

980
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,930
and the infected feces
then fall down to the shore

981
00:52:31,017 --> 00:52:32,540
and gets picked up by the snail.

982
00:52:32,627 --> 00:52:34,063
The whole cycle starts again.

983
00:52:35,195 --> 00:52:37,676
- Sounds like damned
science fiction.

984
00:52:37,763 --> 00:52:40,418
- What if these parasites
are getting into our water?

985
00:52:43,725 --> 00:52:45,423
- Hello.

986
00:52:45,510 --> 00:52:47,425
Today we're talking with
local pop sensation Kim Sweet,

987
00:52:47,512 --> 00:52:49,775
visiting us in our
public access studio

988
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:52,952
and, uh, Kim, uh, I believe
you have something you'd like

989
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,911
to say to the people of
Duluth before we get started?

990
00:52:55,998 --> 00:53:00,873
- Yes, um, I just want to
apologize to the people of Duluth

991
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:07,923
for anything that I said
that was really stupid

992
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:12,798
when I was young and
for any of the hurt

993
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:14,495
that I might have caused.

994
00:53:14,582 --> 00:53:17,846
Um, there are really good
people here in this town

995
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:21,067
and I, um, I'm very, very sorry.

996
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:23,374
Thank you.

997
00:53:25,724 --> 00:53:29,293
- Thank you, Kim, for, um,
your brave and sincere apology.

998
00:53:30,729 --> 00:53:34,602
But, um, what I'd like to talk
to you about today, um, here

999
00:53:34,689 --> 00:53:37,388
is about the deformed frogs
you found near your home?

1000
00:53:37,475 --> 00:53:38,693
- Yes.

1001
00:53:38,780 --> 00:53:40,608
There have been
some deformed frogs

1002
00:53:40,695 --> 00:53:43,350
that have been turning up
in the lakes and the ponds

1003
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:48,442
in the area and we don't
know what is causing it, um,

1004
00:53:49,617 --> 00:53:50,749
but we think it
could be a problem

1005
00:53:50,836 --> 00:53:52,620
and maybe a very
serious problem.

1006
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:55,667
- Well, you know, considering
you're not a scientist

1007
00:53:55,754 --> 00:54:00,149
of any kind, some might accuse
you of being an alarmist.

1008
00:54:01,412 --> 00:54:02,195
- Okay.

1009
00:54:02,282 --> 00:54:03,109
Alright.

1010
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:08,375
Okay, so my, our family dog
had puppies this weekend

1011
00:54:08,462 --> 00:54:10,116
and, um, sorry.

1012
00:54:10,203 --> 00:54:11,509
- Oh, god, okay.

1013
00:54:16,731 --> 00:54:17,993
- This is, this is one.

1014
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:21,910
Does that look alarmist to you?

1015
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,303
I just--

1016
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:24,348
- [Interviewer] I
don't want that...

1017
00:54:24,435 --> 00:54:26,045
Oh, my god, we are so done.

1018
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:26,785
- [Kim] I just, if Mayor
Paulson is watching this...

1019
00:54:26,872 --> 00:54:29,353
[beeps]

1020
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,877
[raining]

1021
00:54:31,964 --> 00:54:34,793
[thunder crashes]

1022
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:45,369
[slow music]

1023
00:55:01,428 --> 00:55:03,865
- What about deviled
ham for breakfast?

1024
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:04,736
- Breakfast?

1025
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:05,519
- Sounds delicious.

1026
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,955
- Grody, Brody.

1027
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:08,696
Alright, pick out a
cereal, you get one.

1028
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:11,090
Hey, hey, hey.

1029
00:55:11,177 --> 00:55:13,135
You want some sugar
to go with your sugar?

1030
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:14,180
Come on, healthy.

1031
00:55:15,616 --> 00:55:16,748
Chocolate sauce?

1032
00:55:16,835 --> 00:55:17,879
That's too expensive.

1033
00:55:19,707 --> 00:55:20,969
- Well, what about this?

1034
00:55:21,056 --> 00:55:22,275
It's kid-tested and
mother approved.

1035
00:55:22,362 --> 00:55:23,842
- Sold.

1036
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:24,712
Alright, we gotta make tracks.

1037
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,279
- Sounds healthy.

1038
00:55:26,366 --> 00:55:27,759
- What you got there, Munchkin?

1039
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:29,804
You want me to go find
you a couple masks?

1040
00:55:29,891 --> 00:55:32,067
[laughs]

1041
00:55:36,898 --> 00:55:39,423
- Dude, get us some bananas.

1042
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,121
- Oh, look, he's
pretending he can read.

1043
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:44,602
- Oh, hey, Joe, looks
like they got a picture

1044
00:55:44,689 --> 00:55:47,300
of your long lost
relative in the paper.

1045
00:55:47,387 --> 00:55:48,127
Huh?

1046
00:55:48,214 --> 00:55:50,738
[laughs]

1047
00:55:50,825 --> 00:55:52,261
- Hey, if he hasn't done
anything to the water,

1048
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,133
how about a blood test?

1049
00:55:54,220 --> 00:55:55,569
See if you're contagious.

1050
00:55:55,656 --> 00:55:57,005
You know, just to
prove everybody wrong?

1051
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:59,356
- You mean prove
you wrong, asshole.

1052
00:55:59,443 --> 00:56:00,922
- Easy, kitten.

1053
00:56:01,009 --> 00:56:02,968
- Yeah, we know what
kind of freak you are.

1054
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:03,795
Calm down.

1055
00:56:03,882 --> 00:56:04,752
- I got an idea.

1056
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:06,928
Why don't we test your kid?

1057
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:08,234
- Hey!

1058
00:56:08,321 --> 00:56:10,454
[punches]

1059
00:56:22,335 --> 00:56:23,902
Hey, uh, Joseph.

1060
00:56:23,989 --> 00:56:28,994
Um, uh, you guys doing okay?

1061
00:56:33,564 --> 00:56:34,782
What are you looking at?

1062
00:56:37,959 --> 00:56:39,134
People can be shits.

1063
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,138
- Please, don't hurt me!

1064
00:56:45,271 --> 00:56:48,535
- Hey, just take
a breath, grandma.

1065
00:56:48,622 --> 00:56:50,668
Hey, hey, hey!

1066
00:56:52,626 --> 00:56:53,714
They're not worth it.

1067
00:57:01,287 --> 00:57:02,593
Hey, it's, uh...

1068
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:04,812
I get it.

1069
00:57:09,338 --> 00:57:11,732
You know, um, we're neighbors.

1070
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:14,126
We live right across the lake.

1071
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:16,911
So if you guys
ever need anything.

1072
00:57:20,872 --> 00:57:23,570
You know, just
don't be a stranger.

1073
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:29,620
[engine starts]

1074
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:33,624
[tires squealing]

1075
00:57:37,497 --> 00:57:40,152
[phone ringing]

1076
00:57:42,807 --> 00:57:43,634
Yeah?

1077
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:47,986
[beeping]

1078
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,559
- Push.
- Come on, push.

1079
00:57:55,646 --> 00:57:56,560
- Keep pushing, good.

1080
00:57:56,647 --> 00:57:57,604
- Yeah.

1081
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,127
- Good, good, keep pushing.

1082
00:57:59,214 --> 00:57:59,911
- Push, dammit, like
you're on a leg press.

1083
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:00,781
Come on, push.

1084
00:58:00,868 --> 00:58:01,913
- Push, push, push.

1085
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,001
- Look, babe, you're doin' good.

1086
00:58:03,088 --> 00:58:03,958
- Good, okay,
alright, good, good.

1087
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:05,003
- [Sam] You gotta push.

1088
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:06,395
You're doing good, come on.

1089
00:58:06,483 --> 00:58:07,135
- [Woman] Good, good,
good, good, good.

1090
00:58:07,222 --> 00:58:07,962
- [Sam] Push.

1091
00:58:08,049 --> 00:58:09,529
Okay, okay, come on, focus.

1092
00:58:09,616 --> 00:58:11,357
That was good.
- That was good.

1093
00:58:11,444 --> 00:58:12,184
- You're doing good.
- Alright, breathe.

1094
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:13,098
Alright, focus!

1095
00:58:14,534 --> 00:58:16,362
- [Sam] Good, good,
good, push. Come on.

1096
00:58:16,449 --> 00:58:17,798
You're doing great, come on.

1097
00:58:17,885 --> 00:58:19,321
- [Woman] That was
good, that was good.

1098
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:20,671
Breathing.

1099
00:58:20,758 --> 00:58:22,020
Alright, here we
go, here's one more.

1100
00:58:22,107 --> 00:58:22,716
- [Sam] You're gonna
go another set.

1101
00:58:22,803 --> 00:58:23,587
- I can't.

1102
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:24,979
- Is this normal?

1103
00:58:25,066 --> 00:58:26,328
She looks like she's
in a lot of pain.

1104
00:58:26,415 --> 00:58:27,765
Breathe. Now we're gonna
do another set, come on.

1105
00:58:27,852 --> 00:58:29,636
- [Woman] Here we go,
one more, one more.

1106
00:58:29,723 --> 00:58:31,029
- [Sam] Just like we're at the
gym, come on, push, come on.

1107
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:31,986
- [Woman] You gotta push.

1108
00:58:32,073 --> 00:58:33,118
- [Sam] Here it comes.

1109
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:35,207
- [screams] Oh my God!

1110
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:36,338
- No, this isn't normal.

1111
00:58:36,425 --> 00:58:38,123
Something's not right.

1112
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,777
- Good, good, good.

1113
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:41,126
The baby's coming, here we go.

1114
00:58:41,213 --> 00:58:42,867
Here we go, here we go!

1115
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:44,695
- You're doing good,
you're doing good.

1116
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:46,348
Get her some pain
pills, come on.

1117
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:47,611
[screaming]

1118
00:58:47,698 --> 00:58:49,003
Push!

1119
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,657
- Good, good, good.

1120
00:58:50,744 --> 00:58:52,050
[baby crying]

1121
00:58:52,137 --> 00:58:54,879
- You did it, you did it.

1122
00:58:54,966 --> 00:58:57,142
[laughs]

1123
00:59:22,907 --> 00:59:23,734
Oh!

1124
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,957
Fuck that!

1125
00:59:45,233 --> 00:59:47,279
[crying]

1126
00:59:51,239 --> 00:59:52,589
- Look, I understand
your concern

1127
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:54,112
but you really don't
need to stay here.

1128
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:56,157
I mean, he'll probably
be out for quite awhile.

1129
00:59:56,244 --> 00:59:57,942
I promise, we'll
keep you updated.

1130
00:59:59,421 --> 01:00:00,292
- Can you just...

1131
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:02,947
Can you at least tell me

1132
01:00:03,034 --> 01:00:04,035
what you think might
have caused the tumor?

1133
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:05,689
- We actually don't know yet.

1134
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,821
He never had regular
checkups over the years so...

1135
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,562
Has he had a history
of alcoholism?

1136
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:10,519
- No.

1137
01:00:12,739 --> 01:00:15,524
I mean, not that I know of.

1138
01:00:16,743 --> 01:00:18,876
- Well, if not I would
think Hepatitis B or C

1139
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:21,879
but he doesn't have
either of those.

1140
01:00:21,966 --> 01:00:24,359
Parasites, arsenic...

1141
01:00:24,446 --> 01:00:25,578
- Parasites?

1142
01:00:25,665 --> 01:00:27,449
- From contaminated water.

1143
01:00:27,536 --> 01:00:29,887
Oh, but that's usually only
found in developing countries

1144
01:00:29,974 --> 01:00:31,149
so I'm sure...

1145
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:33,760
Anyway.

[baby gurgling]

1148
01:00:47,687 --> 01:00:48,470
- Judy.

1149
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:50,429
Hey.

1150
01:00:50,516 --> 01:00:52,474
- Oh, hi, Kim.

1151
01:00:52,561 --> 01:00:53,954
What are you doing here?

1152
01:00:54,041 --> 01:00:56,174
- Yeah, I was just,
uh, checking on my dad.

1153
01:00:56,261 --> 01:00:57,001
- Oh, I heard.

1154
01:00:57,088 --> 01:00:58,524
I'm so sorry.

1155
01:00:58,611 --> 01:01:00,004
I hope he'll be okay.

1156
01:01:00,091 --> 01:01:00,961
- Well, we all missed
seeing you at Mike's.

1157
01:01:01,048 --> 01:01:03,442
I figured the baby came.

1158
01:01:03,529 --> 01:01:04,356
Can I say hello?

1159
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,011
- She's really sick.

1160
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:08,186
- Oh, I just, I
gotta take a peek.

1161
01:01:08,273 --> 01:01:09,970
- She's really sick.

1162
01:01:11,058 --> 01:01:12,625
[baby crying]

1163
01:01:12,712 --> 01:01:13,539
Look, I'm...

1164
01:01:15,236 --> 01:01:16,324
I have to go.

1165
01:01:18,457 --> 01:01:19,327
- What's she got?

1166
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:27,901
- [Interviewer] Some might
accuse you of being an alarmist.

1167
01:01:29,207 --> 01:01:30,991
- [Kim] Okay, alright, uh...

1168
01:01:32,384 --> 01:01:36,127
Okay, so my, our family dog
had puppies this weekend

1169
01:01:36,214 --> 01:01:38,303
and, um, sorry.

1170
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,653
[mumbling]

1171
01:01:46,790 --> 01:01:48,139
What?

1172
01:01:48,226 --> 01:01:50,141
Does that look alarmist to you?

1173
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:51,490
I just--

1174
01:01:51,577 --> 01:01:53,057
- [Interviewer] I
don't want that.

1175
01:01:53,144 --> 01:01:53,622
Oh my God, we are so done.
- [Kim] I just...

1176
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,581
[beeps]

1177
01:02:04,677 --> 01:02:06,897
[knocking]

1178
01:02:10,248 --> 01:02:11,379
- Kim?

1179
01:02:11,466 --> 01:02:12,903
- Hey.

1180
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,296
- Look, Kim, I'm
really busy right now.

1181
01:02:16,297 --> 01:02:19,257
- Judy, look.

1182
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:21,912
I know something's wrong.

1183
01:02:29,484 --> 01:02:31,443
What did you name her?

1184
01:02:32,618 --> 01:02:33,445
- Danielle.

1185
01:02:35,490 --> 01:02:36,622
- That's real pretty.

1186
01:02:40,321 --> 01:02:42,759
- Look, I don't want anyone
else in the town to know.

1187
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:48,765
And please, please don't
let Sam know that you know.

1188
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,726
- Yeah.

1189
01:02:53,813 --> 01:02:54,640
Of course.

1190
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:05,303
[gasps]

1191
01:03:13,398 --> 01:03:14,225
Judy.

1192
01:03:16,836 --> 01:03:17,750
[sighs]

1193
01:03:17,837 --> 01:03:18,664
That's...

1194
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:25,018
Listen, do you mind if I...

1195
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:28,456
Could I take a few photos?

1196
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,634
- Why do you want to
take pictures of my baby?

1197
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:35,594
- Look, I know... I know this
has got to be so hard for you.

1198
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:36,508
I can't even...

1199
01:03:38,336 --> 01:03:39,685
I can't even imagine.

1200
01:03:39,772 --> 01:03:41,469
But if I could just
take a few pictures,

1201
01:03:41,556 --> 01:03:46,170
just collect some evidence,
then maybe we could get help.

1202
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,432
- Help for what?

1203
01:03:51,523 --> 01:03:54,221
- Don't you want to
know what caused this?

1204
01:03:54,308 --> 01:03:56,049
- These things happen.

1205
01:03:56,136 --> 01:03:57,398
And it's nature.

1206
01:03:57,485 --> 01:03:58,835
It's not like I'm
the first one ever.

1207
01:04:03,883 --> 01:04:05,798
- What about the
animal deformities?

1208
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:06,843
What about those--

1209
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,192
- What are you saying now,

1210
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:09,236
that my baby is
some kind of animal?

1211
01:04:09,323 --> 01:04:10,847
Is that what you're saying?

1212
01:04:10,934 --> 01:04:11,804
- No.

1213
01:04:11,891 --> 01:04:12,892
No, Judy.

1214
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:13,937
I, um...

1215
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:17,984
Look, here.

1216
01:04:20,073 --> 01:04:21,727
Please just take a look at this.

1217
01:04:37,482 --> 01:04:38,570
I'm so sorry.

1218
01:04:44,924 --> 01:04:47,318
[slow music]

1219
01:05:21,569 --> 01:05:22,353
Here's your proof.

1220
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,963
Take it and use it.

1221
01:05:24,050 --> 01:05:25,138
We need to keep pesticides
out of the wetlands.

1222
01:05:25,225 --> 01:05:26,705
- Are you following me?

1223
01:05:26,792 --> 01:05:28,663
- At least call the Governor

1224
01:05:28,750 --> 01:05:30,535
and stop telling everybody
that things are fine

1225
01:05:30,622 --> 01:05:31,362
when you know that--

1226
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:33,190
- Miss Sweet.

1227
01:05:33,277 --> 01:05:35,409
I know that you've had some
puppies born with complications

1228
01:05:35,496 --> 01:05:38,195
but different is
not necessarily bad.

1229
01:05:39,370 --> 01:05:40,458
Okay, that's bad.

1230
01:05:41,502 --> 01:05:44,549
Uh, where did this happen?

1231
01:05:44,636 --> 01:05:47,030
- Where do you
think it happened?

1232
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:48,161
God, what smells?

1233
01:05:48,248 --> 01:05:49,597
I think that salmon is bad.

1234
01:05:49,684 --> 01:05:51,034
- No, the salmon is
actually very good.

1235
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:53,819
You know, you can
have some if you want.

1236
01:05:53,906 --> 01:05:55,734
So who did this happen to?

1237
01:05:55,821 --> 01:05:58,345
- She doesn't want to be
identified in the media.

1238
01:05:58,432 --> 01:05:59,172
- Right.

1239
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:00,521
Okay.

1240
01:06:00,608 --> 01:06:01,261
So why is this
happening so quickly?

1241
01:06:01,348 --> 01:06:02,001
- Parasites.

1242
01:06:03,307 --> 01:06:04,395
- Not pesticides?

1243
01:06:04,482 --> 01:06:05,309
- No.

1244
01:06:07,006 --> 01:06:09,139
Pesticides and fertilizer
dramatically increase algae

1245
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:11,706
and plant material
that snails feed on.

1246
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:13,230
- So snails are the bad guys?

1247
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:15,623
- Snails are the hosts
for the parasite babies.

1248
01:06:16,885 --> 01:06:18,365
- Parasite babies?

1249
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:22,848
- You know, little parasite
baby maggot things?

1250
01:06:22,935 --> 01:06:23,936
- Oh, the larvae?

1251
01:06:24,023 --> 01:06:25,329
- Exactly.

1252
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:27,766
Look, you wanted
evidence, here it is.

1253
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:31,074
More pesticides, more
snails, more parasites.

1254
01:06:31,161 --> 01:06:32,771
- Got a problem

1255
01:06:32,858 --> 01:06:34,903
and that is we've had
pesticides around for decades.

1256
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,949
Why is this happening now?

1257
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:38,298
- Well, you said yourself

1258
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,126
that this spring
was the first time

1259
01:06:40,213 --> 01:06:42,215
that American Patriots Chemicals
have been used in the area?

1260
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:45,566
Okay, well maybe there's something
in their eco-friendly mix

1261
01:06:45,653 --> 01:06:47,525
that gives the algae a boost.

1262
01:06:49,179 --> 01:06:53,357
Look, and there's also deformed
frog sightings upstate.

1263
01:06:54,358 --> 01:06:55,576
This year and last year.

1264
01:06:58,536 --> 01:07:00,277
- [Mayor] Are these the places

1265
01:07:00,364 --> 01:07:01,974
where you found the deformities?

1266
01:07:02,061 --> 01:07:02,888
- [Kim] Yeah.

1267
01:07:04,629 --> 01:07:06,892
- These are the same locations
as the disappearances.

1268
01:07:08,372 --> 01:07:12,767
But if we're looking for a
kidnapper, serial killer,

1269
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:17,555
then why would that
correspond to the deformities?

1270
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:18,643
- You think they're connected?

1271
01:07:18,730 --> 01:07:19,687
God, how can you stand that?

1272
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:20,688
That smell is awful.

1273
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:22,081
- What, this?

1274
01:07:22,168 --> 01:07:25,128
No, this is yummy.

1275
01:07:25,215 --> 01:07:26,477
- [Kim] Ugh.

1276
01:07:26,564 --> 01:07:28,044
- I think you just
don't like fish.

1277
01:07:28,131 --> 01:07:29,088
- No, I normally love salmon.

1278
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:30,829
That shit is rank.

1279
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:31,917
- I promise you it's not.

1280
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:33,484
- Ugh, excuse me.

1281
01:07:34,485 --> 01:07:35,573
- Are you alright?

1282
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:41,666
[ominous music]

1283
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:10,695
[camera clicks]

1284
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:11,826
- Hey!

1285
01:08:11,913 --> 01:08:13,306
What, what's with the pictures?

1286
01:08:13,393 --> 01:08:14,525
- I was just taking a picture

1287
01:08:14,612 --> 01:08:16,744
of that pregnant
lady over there.

1288
01:08:16,831 --> 01:08:18,964
Might be one of
them monster babies.

1289
01:08:19,834 --> 01:08:20,661
- What?

1290
01:08:23,273 --> 01:08:24,709
Get out of here!

1291
01:08:24,796 --> 01:08:26,493
- Months earlier.

1292
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,365
Most recent numbers in the
birth defect outbreak are...

1293
01:08:28,452 --> 01:08:29,627
- Christ, Kim.

1294
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:32,978
You can't be pulling that kind
of stuff with the tourists.

1295
01:08:33,065 --> 01:08:35,067
They spend a lot
of money in here.

1296
01:08:35,154 --> 01:08:36,199
- Yeah, but did
you see his shirt?

1297
01:08:36,286 --> 01:08:37,243
- Oh, I know, I know.

1298
01:08:37,330 --> 01:08:38,505
They're everywhere.

1299
01:08:39,637 --> 01:08:41,334
Hey, I'm sorry about your dad.

1300
01:08:42,292 --> 01:08:43,206
- Yeah.

1301
01:08:43,293 --> 01:08:44,120
Thanks.

1302
01:08:45,773 --> 01:08:47,166
Where's Greg?

1303
01:08:47,253 --> 01:08:48,907
- [Bartender] You didn't hear?

1304
01:08:48,994 --> 01:08:50,822
- No, I've been off
a few days. What?

1305
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:54,391
- His sister gave birth to
one of those mutant babies.

1306
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:55,827
- Oh, no.

1307
01:08:55,914 --> 01:08:56,871
Is she okay?

1308
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,743
- [scoffs] She's in shock.

1309
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:02,181
I mean, I think they're gonna
give it up to the researchers.

1310
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:03,226
- What?

1311
01:09:03,313 --> 01:09:04,314
- Well, what would you do?

1312
01:09:06,011 --> 01:09:06,794
- I don't know but I don't
know if I'd pawn it off

1313
01:09:06,881 --> 01:09:07,882
like some lab rat.

1314
01:09:07,969 --> 01:09:09,406
- Well, it's not going away.

1315
01:09:09,493 --> 01:09:11,799
I mean, everybody's leaving.

1316
01:09:11,886 --> 01:09:14,628
And the whole town
might get quarantined.

1317
01:09:14,715 --> 01:09:17,370
And the crazy thing is

1318
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:21,069
all these tourists
keep coming in here.

1319
01:09:23,028 --> 01:09:25,683
- Yeah, checking out more
than the fall leaves, huh?

1320
01:09:26,510 --> 01:09:27,380
- Yeah.

1321
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:32,168
- I personally investigated

1322
01:09:32,255 --> 01:09:34,344
since the first
deformed frog was found.

1323
01:09:35,736 --> 01:09:38,391
The Governor has been made
fully aware of our situation.

1324
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:40,393
The Environmental
Protection Agency,

1325
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,179
the Center for Disease Control
have also been notified.

1326
01:09:44,397 --> 01:09:47,792
The citizens of Duluth
will be taken care of.

1327
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:53,711
- The birth defect
outbreak are...

[rips]

1330
01:10:19,127 --> 01:10:20,390
- What's your problem?

1331
01:10:20,477 --> 01:10:22,043
- She-freak must
be his girlfriend.

1332
01:10:25,786 --> 01:10:27,179
That's what my dad said
should be done to you

1333
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:29,050
and your creepy dad.

1334
01:10:29,137 --> 01:10:30,661
- Why?

1335
01:10:30,748 --> 01:10:33,098
- Because of you, my aunt's
baby's all messed up.

1336
01:10:33,185 --> 01:10:35,231
[smacks]

[sighs]

1340
01:11:13,181 --> 01:11:15,009
- Trent Douglas.

1341
01:11:15,096 --> 01:11:15,923
- Yes?

1342
01:11:21,146 --> 01:11:22,103
- We need to talk.

1343
01:11:26,325 --> 01:11:29,067
[dog whimpering]

1344
01:11:29,981 --> 01:11:30,938
- What is it, girl?

1345
01:11:45,997 --> 01:11:46,867
What is it?

1346
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:48,565
Shh, shh.

1347
01:11:50,175 --> 01:11:51,045
It's okay.

1348
01:11:51,132 --> 01:11:52,090
Shh, sweetie.

1349
01:11:52,177 --> 01:11:52,960
Shh, shh.

1350
01:11:55,876 --> 01:11:58,357
Stop, shh, it's alright,
it's okay, it's alright.

1351
01:11:58,444 --> 01:12:00,272
It's alright, girl, it's okay.

1352
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:01,186
Please.

1353
01:12:04,711 --> 01:12:05,756
Stop.

1354
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:07,061
Stop.

1355
01:12:07,148 --> 01:12:08,324
Shh, shh, shh.

1356
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:19,987
Ugh, ugh.

1357
01:12:21,815 --> 01:12:23,426
Well, could you just come out
here and look at her, please?

1358
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:24,427
Please.

1359
01:12:24,514 --> 01:12:26,080
It's awful.

1360
01:12:29,388 --> 01:12:30,215
Trent?

1361
01:12:33,392 --> 01:12:34,219
Trent?

1362
01:12:44,142 --> 01:12:45,317
What the fuck?

1363
01:12:48,581 --> 01:12:51,279
[beeping]

1364
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:52,150
Okay.

1365
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:56,023
- Yeah.

1366
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:56,850
- How's that?

1367
01:12:56,937 --> 01:12:58,374
- Mm-hm, mm-hm.

1368
01:13:00,811 --> 01:13:01,768
- [Kim] That better?

1369
01:13:07,513 --> 01:13:08,340
- Thanks.

1370
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:12,257
How's my dog?

1371
01:13:14,564 --> 01:13:15,913
- She's, she's fine.

1372
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:17,915
Yeah.

1373
01:13:21,788 --> 01:13:25,401
- I want you to take her
and Brody and leave town.

1374
01:13:28,969 --> 01:13:30,275
- Why would we leave?

1375
01:13:40,590 --> 01:13:43,419
- Honey, the cancer
is inoperable.

1376
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:45,856
It always was.

1377
01:13:48,032 --> 01:13:49,947
The tumor's growing real fast.

1378
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,951
You never have as much
time as you think you will.

1379
01:13:56,606 --> 01:13:58,216
- God damn it, Pops.

1380
01:14:00,261 --> 01:14:01,785
Why didn't you fucking tell me?

1381
01:14:03,613 --> 01:14:05,528
- Wanted to give you hope.

1382
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:09,706
I figured if the surgery was
always a little ways off,

1383
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:12,230
maybe you'd stick around longer.

1384
01:14:15,973 --> 01:14:17,365
I'm sorry I hurt you.

1385
01:14:26,897 --> 01:14:27,724
Come here.

1386
01:14:31,249 --> 01:14:32,424
Hold my hand.

1387
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:34,557
[crying]

1388
01:14:41,955 --> 01:14:43,653
Oh, you know as well as anyone

1389
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:47,091
that none of us knows
what the hell we're doing.

1390
01:14:47,178 --> 01:14:51,356
We just do what we
think best at the time.

1391
01:14:54,185 --> 01:14:55,012
- Yeah.

1392
01:15:01,018 --> 01:15:01,845
I do.

1393
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:07,851
We're...

1394
01:15:11,681 --> 01:15:13,378
And we're not going anywhere.

1395
01:15:35,052 --> 01:15:37,837
[ominous music]

1396

[knocking]

1397
01:16:05,996 --> 01:16:06,997
- Hello, Sam.

1398
01:16:07,084 --> 01:16:08,041
- Hey, Sam.

1399
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,829
Look, Sam, I've been thinking
about this on the way over.

1400
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:14,178
- No, shut up.

1401
01:16:14,265 --> 01:16:15,005
We had an agreement.

1402
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:16,833
Okay?

1403
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:18,922
You guys do mine and if they
need it, I'll do your sister's.

1404
01:16:19,879 --> 01:16:21,098
It's gonna be easier this way.

1405
01:16:21,185 --> 01:16:22,447
Trust me.

1406
01:16:22,534 --> 01:16:24,014
- Look, man, this
is really crazy.

1407
01:16:24,101 --> 01:16:25,450
We can't...

1408
01:16:25,537 --> 01:16:27,060
- Look. Look at what
it's doing to her.

1409
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:28,453
Okay?

1410
01:16:28,540 --> 01:16:29,933
That thing is not human.

1411
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,153
- God.

1412
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,242
I mean, aside from getting
caught, we can't...

1413
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:36,635
- We're not gonna get caught

1414
01:16:36,722 --> 01:16:38,202
because we're all
in agreement, right?

1415
01:16:40,030 --> 01:16:41,031
Right?

1416
01:16:41,118 --> 01:16:42,554
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1417
01:16:42,641 --> 01:16:43,990
- Yeah.

1418
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:47,298
- Okay, now, let's
just stick to the plan.

1419
01:16:50,214 --> 01:16:52,129
Come on, stick to the
plan. Get in there.

1420
01:16:53,391 --> 01:16:54,218
Come on.

1421
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:57,874
- Hey, Judy.

1422
01:16:57,961 --> 01:16:58,788
- Hi.

1423
01:17:00,659 --> 01:17:04,837
- So, uh, how do you
want to do this, Sam?

1424
01:17:06,012 --> 01:17:07,492
- What are you, what
are you gonna do?

1425
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:16,414
- It's doing something to you.

1426
01:17:16,501 --> 01:17:18,416
I mean, hell, for all I know,

1427
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:21,462
it could be spreading
something to me.

1428
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:22,376
Come on.

1429
01:17:23,813 --> 01:17:24,727
Give it here.

1430
01:17:24,814 --> 01:17:25,684
We'll take it.

1431
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:26,816
- Her name is Danielle.

1432
01:17:27,730 --> 01:17:28,992
It's Danielle.

1433
01:17:29,079 --> 01:17:31,342
[coughing]

1434
01:17:36,521 --> 01:17:37,565
No, don't, don't.

1435
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:38,392
No!

1436

[baby crying]

1437
01:17:39,611 --> 01:17:40,656
- Give me, give me that thing!

1438
01:17:40,743 --> 01:17:41,569
- No, no!

1439

[coughing]

1440
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:50,056
- Take it to the bathroom!

01:17:50,143 --> 01:17:52,363
[retching]

1442
01:17:55,322 --> 01:17:57,673
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

1443
01:18:02,416 --> 01:18:03,243
- Go!

1444
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:09,467
- No, no!

1445

[gentle music]

1448
01:19:24,934 --> 01:19:26,631
- Sorry about Chuck.

1449
01:19:32,811 --> 01:19:33,943
- You hung up on me.

1450
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,860
Why did you do that?

1451
01:19:37,947 --> 01:19:38,991
- I...

1452
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:40,732
- Why didn't you call me back?

1453
01:19:40,819 --> 01:19:42,212
- I was gonna call you back.

1454
01:19:43,953 --> 01:19:45,432
I just...

1455
01:19:45,519 --> 01:19:46,782
I'm sorry, I was...

1456
01:19:50,089 --> 01:19:51,787
I was just dealing
with something.

1457
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:01,057
- Just don't.

1458
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:10,240
- Do you want to tell me
what happened to Kinky?

1459
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,981
- I don't even fucking know.

1460
01:20:14,984 --> 01:20:16,289
She started shaking.

1461
01:20:16,376 --> 01:20:17,377
She couldn't stop.

1462
01:20:17,464 --> 01:20:19,118
I tried to hold her still

1463
01:20:19,205 --> 01:20:22,252
and her skin was so thin it
tore underneath my fingers.

1464
01:20:23,993 --> 01:20:25,690
She shook and shook and shook

1465
01:20:25,777 --> 01:20:27,823
and then vomited all over
herself and then she was dead.

1466
01:20:30,521 --> 01:20:32,828
- The fetus leaves behind
a parasite infestation

1467
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:34,786
carried over from the water.

1468
01:20:34,873 --> 01:20:37,397
Theoretically this could
affect an entire generation

1469
01:20:37,484 --> 01:20:39,095
of a species.

1470
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:40,270

the CDC and EPA will be

to areas surrounding
the Great Lakes.

Two cases with similar

in the Green Bay, Wisconsin area

Milwaukee and another two

in the Detroit, Michigan area.

1688
01:34:11,210 --> 01:34:13,560
Many of these areas
had previous reports

of deformed wildlife.

1690
01:34:15,519 --> 01:34:18,740
It's believed a deadly combination
of organic pesticides,

1691
01:34:18,827 --> 01:34:21,264
fertilizer and
parasites in the water

1692
01:34:21,351 --> 01:34:23,483
may have led directly
to the outbreak
