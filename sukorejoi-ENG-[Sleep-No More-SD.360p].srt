00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:55,139
Sure, but you don't think
it was the Cogniphan?

165
00:11:55,183 --> 00:11:56,837
No.

166
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,491
It was whatever else he was
taking with the Cogniphan.

167
00:11:58,534 --> 00:11:59,840

I searched his room before EMS
and the police arrived.

170

He had a prescription for it.

application to the study.

I don't know.

00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:15,725
Could be tomorrow,

176

could be before
the fall semester begins.

177
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,120
So it's just indefinite?

about us, did you?

What? No.

Thank you.

Look, I-I know.
I know you wanted to get rich.

Yay, money.

we could really help people?

really do some good.

Yes, they are.

Well, I was
gonna say shortsighted,

208
00:14:44,308 --> 00:14:45,701
but that works too.

209
00:14:49,488 --> 00:14:52,012
I guess I could teach.

wouldn't be too hard.

We have the research,
we're all here.

Okay, but then what?

Well, we don't even know if
it was working properly, right?

00:16:28,369 --> 00:16:30,719
Look at the numbers.

247
00:16:30,763 --> 00:16:33,766
At 96 hours without sleep,

248
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,942
we start to see upticks
in brain wave activity,

249
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:39,815
both in cognitive tests
and in vitals,

250
00:16:39,859 --> 00:16:42,470
all of it
statistically significant.

251
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:46,256
Based on these projections,
and this is just an estimate,

252
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,607
we will hit the lucidity point
in 8.3 days --

253
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,217
that's roughly 200 hours --

254
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:52,523
once the Cogniphan's
administered.

255
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:54,351
That's the threshold
we need to hit.

256
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:57,267
That's when we break through.

257
00:16:57,311 --> 00:17:00,880
And the need for sleep
is just gone.

258
00:17:00,923 --> 00:17:03,186
I'm sorry,
but shouldn't we go back

259
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,884
to testing in the second phase?

260
00:17:04,927 --> 00:17:07,887

to shoot up those monkeys,

- Sure you do.

I hate to be callous, but Carter
was manically depressed

another opinion.

All right.

273
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:39,222
We could take this
and get some grants, go private.

274
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:40,920
But I don't think any of you
want to hand this over

275
00:17:40,963 --> 00:17:41,964
to a corporation, am I right?

276
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:46,621

That is exactly what this is.

A world without sleep, right?
Just think about it.

289
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,574
It wouldn't just increase
workforce productivity

290

and make for a better soldier.

291

is all we need.

00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,706

claw my own eyes out.

00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,669
Pass.

308
00:19:18,713 --> 00:19:22,543
Look, Carter was on trazodone,
250 milligrams per day.

309

That's a big dose.

1246
01:22:14,877 --> 01:22:16,487
The idea is that when your brain

those are beta waves.
