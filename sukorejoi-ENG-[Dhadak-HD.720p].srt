you are seeing
my face since childhood

25
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,650
Brother, she came in my dreams

26
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,250
She comes daily anyway

27
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,170
think of the almighty
god someday maybe

28
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,140
this time she was saying,
I will win the competition

29
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,720
and she will give
me the prize personally

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,370
You will win only if you reach

31
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,410
You are late idiot, let's go

32
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,190
What?

33
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,660
c'mon you are late already

34
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,910
You start the bike I'll come

35
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,000
Where are you going?

36
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
PSYLLIUM

37
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,000
Competition is at its peak!

38
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,720
Manish is stuffing the
spicy-snack and so is Devilal

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,370
And Bheema has blasted his burp...

40
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:38,830
Bheema's wife Kajri is
expecting in the hospital

41
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,470
but today his stomach
appears as if he is also expecting

42
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,910
He has stuffed all the spicy-snacks...

43
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,040
And here comes Madhukar Bagla,
alarming everyone alert

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,790
Madhu has arrived,
Devilal is on his last piece of snack

45
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,580
One after another snacks are
making their ways to his stomach

46
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:56,750
Madhu, eat them all....

47
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:59,750
long live mother India...

48
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,970
You idiot, what has mother
India got to do with a spicy-snack!

49
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,190
buzz off...

50
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,790
Gulp faster faster!
Bheema, Devilal, Manish

51
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,910
This is war, the food war

52
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:16,920
The winner will get a Bihar tour,
looser will get a jail tour.

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,460
C'mom Madhu...

54
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,750
Bheema is off towards the sweet-snack
stall, so is Devilal behind him

55
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:27,120
Well done Bheema! great job Devilal!

56
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,200
Madhu has geared up now and has made
a fierce attack on the pile of rice

57
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:34,040
Who do you think will win the race?

58
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,390
Devilal or...

59
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,000
What the hell are you doing?

60
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:40,450
You wife is in labor in the hospital
and you are stuffing sweets over hear!

61
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,000
- No mom...
- Come

62
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,810
Enough, let's go

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,460
Bheema is out of the race now...

64
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:54,620
a mother is a nation's pride
and Madhukar is now on a food ride

65
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:57,530
Who will win the race?

66
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,360
Devilal or Madhu?

67
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,920
Who will win the race?

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,330
Who will become Udaipur's Rambo?

69
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,620
Devilal is charging
towards the chillies

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,620
Moving ahead through the pit...

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,500
but Purshottam has grabbed him

72
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,620
He is still trying to make his way...

73
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:16,120
and finally he manages
to throw Purshottam off him

74
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,070
Madhu is charging ahead

75
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,000
Madhu is going towards the chillies...

76
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:25,750
and Madhu has arrived
at the chillies stall

77
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,840
These are green spicy chillies

78
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:34,410
And meanwhile we have the competition's
special guest of honour Mr Ratan Singh...

79
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:40,740
his son Roop Singh and the entire
royal family is arriving at the venue

80
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,080
He is going ahead... hurry up

81
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,710
Madhu is running like a cheetah

82
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:29,580
both are moving towards
the last leap together

83
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,150
Moving ahead

84
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,830
[Indistinct chatter]

85
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,850
Madhu has taken the big leap

86
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,700
Devi has done a crash landing

87
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:47,780
And Madhu has won
the eat and run race!

88
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,590
First runner up is Devilal Singh

89
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,730
How are you uncle?

90
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,270
Roop, you hand him the prize

91
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,400
- Applause
- Stand here

92
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,540
Take this, try to win sometime, aren't
you tired of coming second always!

93
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,670
Sorry brother

94
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,870
Now leave

95
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:11,040
And the winner is Madhukar Bagla

96
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,410
Winner's envelope
has Rs 250...

97
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:17,620
a gift hamper from Haldiram

98
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:23,200
And a branded stand fan
and a mixer grinder from Mr Ratan

99
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,460
Parthavi, you give

100
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,940
You were gobbling all those chillies!
you are ok right?

101
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,560
Yes yes..

102
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,450
You know English?

103
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,940
Yes yes, of course

104
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,650
Congratulations

105
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:56,790
Thanks

106
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,660
Keep applauding, lets demonstrate
the strength in our hands

107
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,200
As everyone is aware that Mr Ratan Singh
is standing in the election this time

108
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,870
Mr Ratan Singh,
the mic is all yours now

109
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,570
Applause...

110
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,610
Everyone is pointing fingers at me

111
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,180
Opposition says...

112
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:41,930
that Ratan Singh is new to politics

113
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,080
They are calling
me a political intern

114
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:51,440
They have forgotten that
ruling people is in my blood

115
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:58,000
It was only the public love that
gave my ancestors the status of royals

116
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,910
I too can talk foul
about the opposition

117
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:07,090
Sulekha Goenka talks about the
development and progress of Udaipur

118
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,710
But in fact Udaipur's progress lies
in it's sacraments

119
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,170
What about that?

120
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,910
Go and ask her...

121
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,550
whom was her daughter
caught with in Mumbai?

122
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,620
I don't want to tarnish
anyone's reputation

123
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:38,110
but I know how to bend
a finger that's pointing towards me

124
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:42,470
So Mrs Sulekha Goenka...

125
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:48,160
you have eaten enough so far

126
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,450
now its time to run away

127
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,570
Long live Ratan Singh

128
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,240
Isn't it cool mom?

129
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:06,200
Very cool, it's giving very cold air

130
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:10,410
You are an illiterate!
It's a fan, not an air conditioner

131
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,740
How would I know!

132
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,580
have you ever got
me an air conditioner?

133
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,240
Madhu at least got a fan

134
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,540
And that too a branded one,
the costliest

135
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,740
Shall I call your dad and tell him that
you come here to stalk foreigners?

136
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,120
Do not threaten me uncle,
I am not scared

137
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,040
Wait...

138
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,620
Okay, relax

139
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,240
What? Stop giggling...

140
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,790
go to the kitchen
and start making dough

141
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:36,540
Leave

142
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:40,910
Arvind uncle has sent a
new pair of shirt-pant for you

143
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,620
Wear it during Diwali

144
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,490
- It is very good!
- isn't it?

145
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,790
Call your uncle and thank him

146
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,410
It's looking really nice,
I am trying it now only

147
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:55,790
I have told you don't
accept any gifts from Arvind

148
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,910
He is my brother, I will

149
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,200
I don't like him and you know that

150
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:03,830
I also don't like you,
but one has to redeem a relationship

151
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:04,750
Leave me then

152
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,120
Is it open yet?

153
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:07,990
Yes yes open

154
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,910
Madhu come fast
customers have arrived

155
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,620
Sit sit, please

156
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,700
Parthavi!

157
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,950
Take it Ambika, you also fire a shot

158
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:25,370
I don't want to fire

159
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,450
Try it once, it's too much fun

160
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,490
Are you enjoying here?

161
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,870
Yes really enjoying!

162
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,540
This time my father is
standing for the election

163
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,710
Oh wow! That's great!

164
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,340
- This is for you
- Thank you

165
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,660
So all good?

166
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,300
Yeah great, thank you

167
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,740
Good Morning

168
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,370
Good Morning

169
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,040
Hello

170
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,860
All well?

171
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,790
Yes, your son is
taking good care of us

172
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:50,790
Thank You

173
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,040
Roop I want to have
a word with you, come

174
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,490
Okay enjoy

175
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,880
I'm coming back

176
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,890
You are the owner of this mansion,
not a waiter

177
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:06,570
Greet the guests, smile at them,
serving beer is not our job

178
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,020
Sorry dad

179
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:11,450
Go check the preparations
in the office

180
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,200
Yes

181
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,080
Hello uncle

182
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,160
Bless you

183
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,740
Where are you both going?

184
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,580
pond

185
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
It will be cold

186
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,910
Then put a heater in the pond,
it won't be cold then

187
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,120
But I will go for sure

188
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,200
Sure

189
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,990
Bye dad

190
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,120
Hey

191
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,580
Devi

192
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,380
Come out

193
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:43,540
What happened?

194
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,950
It's my swimming time

195
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,790
But we just came

196
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,330
So what should I do? C'mon leave

197
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,830
This is not right Parthavi

198
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,140
Then go complain to your parents
Leave now

199
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,160
Let's go

200
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,160
Get out

201
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,040
Look at him

202
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,450
Hey, don't cover your head,
protect your back

203
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
There is a hole in your underwear

204
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,490
That white palace behind that
is Jagmandir. You know Jennifer Lopez?

205
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,160
Sure I know

206
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,950
You know Jennifer Lopez!

207
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,120
Jennifer Lopez also came
here to sing and dance...

208
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,120
in a very big wedding
of rich Indian man

209
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,990
Madhu

210
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,580
Madhu!

211
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,890
Parthavi has come at the pond

212
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:52,370
What is he saying?

213
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:54,540
Don't know. Say loudly!

214
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:57,870
Parthavi...

215
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:02,700
At the pond

216
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,620
Parthavi...

217
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,510
At the pond

218
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:16,500
Who is that?

219
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,330
He is my friend...

220
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:24,930
You leave him, here, evening
you should come to my restaurant

221
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,580
Parthavi...

222
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:37,490
At the pond

223
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,780
Indian Romeo...

224
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,520
You see Taj hotel

225
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,490
Get out

226
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,700
You speak english?

227
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,290
Get out

228
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,470
Calm down...

229
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,300
Madhu!

230
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,260
Mom it's burning badly

231
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,510
Doctor I won't limp right?

232
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,470
I am still a bachelor,
what will the bride's family think!

233
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:50,340
They won't think anything

234
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,220
Stop your drama, it's a scratch

235
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,380
It's hurting

236
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,580
Might have to amputate

237
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,630
Isn't this the same
shirt your uncle gifted?

238
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,050
Weren't you suppose
to wear it during Diwali!

239
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:00,880
It is indeed a Diwali for him today

240
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,050
What?

241
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:03,880
Rubbish

242
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,590
I thought of checking the fittings

243
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,050
Fittings?

244
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,420
Fitting looks great

245
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:13,470
Rest for half an hour,
then you can go home

246
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:17,550
Make the payment at the counter

247
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,510
Sure

248
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:23,470
It is just a scratch

249
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,130
Hello

250
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,920
What did the doctor say?

251
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,840
It's a heart attack,
could slip into a coma

252
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:50,260
Nothing, just a scratch.
Only two days, I am fine

253
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,340
I came to say sorry

254
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,760
Why are you saying sorry?
The mistake was all mine

255
00:20:58,170 --> 00:20:59,670
But the pond was mine

256
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,970
Let's go Parthavi

257
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,630
You will have tea water anything?

258
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,720
At the clinic?

259
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,510
Yes, our restaurant
does home delivery as well

260
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,590
Well, we too are in first year

261
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,840
Since three years

262
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,920
You-all flunked?

263
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:18,510
No no, we were waiting

264
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,760
And you?
How long you have been in first year?

265
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,880
He is not in college

266
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,470
He flunked the 12th grade thrice
continuously hence was suspended, isn't it?

267
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:40,630
Take care. Such stunts might hurt you

268
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,510
Yes yes.

269
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,760
You snake, why are you
spewing venom on my love story

270
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,590
You have no shame or what?
Stalking a child!

271
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,550
Is she your child? your child?

272
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,670
And why were you hitting on my head,
what if my hair would have fallen?

273
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,590
Use a shampoo someday then!

274
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,430
I'll kill you

275
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:08,220
Entire Rajasthan
knows that you are bald

276
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,510
Table number eight's bill

277
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:12,800
Hey Gokul

278
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,170
Six breads, one portion red meat,
one lentil

279
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,550
for table number four

280
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:18,170
Listen

281
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,880
She was Ratan Singh's daughter right?

282
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:26,340
Yeah

283
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:31,470
Don't be stupid
You aren't that naive to understand

284
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,760
Those are upper-cast people,
stay away from them

285
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,380
Otherwise we will get into trouble

286
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,760
Understood?

287
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,510
Yes

288
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,840
Swear on me,
you'll stay away from her

289
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:46,220
What are you doing dad?
Customers are waiting, let me go

290
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,640
You swear on me that
you'll stay away from her

291
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,550
I am not sitting in her lap
I am at a distance!

292
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,430
Dear, the moment she smiles
you will jump into her lap

293
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,340
What is this dad?

294
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:55,800
Swear on me that you
will stay away from her

295
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:56,840
You swear on me first

296
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,670
What are you doing?

297
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,300
Swear on me that you'll
stay away from her

298
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,420
I swear on you

299
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:06,800
Look Madhu...

300
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,170
I said, swear on you

301
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,880
You too are in A division. Let's go

302
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,840
Madhu, check my division as well.

303
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:33,840
You see on your own.

304
00:23:35,170 --> 00:23:38,220
The board is at a distance and the queue
is long, you check and let me know

305
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,630
Make way guys, respect a senior!

306
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:46,130
Miss Ambika,
you both are also in A division

307
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,260
What happened?

308
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,510
Manik Sisodia

309
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,220
Present sir

310
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,550
Madhukar Bagla

311
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,800
Present sir

312
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,420
Nakul Khaitan

313
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:01,420
Present sir

314
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,670
Parthavi Singh

315
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:06,340
Parthavi Singh!!

316
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:08,670
Present sir

317
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,090
Where is your attention?

318
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,970
My attention is all here only,
you continue

319
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,970
- Radhika Zawar
- Present sir

320
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,970
What's your name?

321
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:22,340
Purshottam,
but I am known as 'the wall' also

322
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,130
You don't belong to this class!

323
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,720
Sir I don't belong
to the college also

324
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:32,130
I flunked the 12th grade,
but I want another chance sir

325
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,910
Go to the principal if
you want another chance. Get out

326
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,760
Sir why you want to go
to the higher authorities?

327
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:37,970
Let's settle it out here only

328
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:38,970
Get out

329
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:40,760
Sir... sir...

330
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,970
Sir I dance very well

331
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,510
I can keep the entertainment
quotient going

332
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,470
Get out

333
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,550
Get out

334
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,510
Okay!

335
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:54,170
Bye!

336
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,050
College will have to
give me a second chance

337
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,090
Not second, fourth

338
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,800
Listen, go tell Madhu
my bike isn't starting

339
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,420
It did right now

340
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,130
Do as I say

341
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:25,680
Madhu... bike isn't starting,
please come and help

342
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,970
Ya ya I am coming

343
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,630
Hey Purshottam...

344
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,840
I won't be able to do it...

345
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,550
You should rather call a mechanic

346
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Just a month away. It is imperative
to win the election this time

347
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,090
You will only win Mr Ratan

348
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:04,800
Everybody is supporting you
in entire Udaipur

349
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,260
I have delivered a
lakh rupees at your house

350
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,910
There wasn't any need of that sir!

351
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,470
It's Roop's birthday three
days prior to the election

352
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,420
You have to give a
birthday present to me

353
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:34,800
Organise a raid at Sulekha's hotel to seize
fake liquor, drugs or whatever you can

354
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,050
But Mr Ratan she is in power

355
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:45,470
Power is an interesting thing! Today
it's with her, tomorrow it will mine

356
00:26:46,490 --> 00:26:50,760
I am sure you won't
disappoint our friendship

357
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,170
Why did you take the bike?

358
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,090
The keys was on the bike so I took it

359
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,760
Keys were on bike means!
I will slap you if you touch it again

360
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,380
I will. Stop me if you can

361
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,470
Do not mess with me

362
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:59,840
I will request Ambika to perform
this dance during our honeymoon

363
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,130
She is dancing horribly

364
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,090
Madhu

365
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:25,720
Stop

366
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
I'll get you rusticated from college

367
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,590
Come here

368
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,380
I don't have the whole day
come quickly

369
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:45,670
Look at me or I'll slap you

370
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,920
Couldn't you hear while I was calling?

371
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,420
I think some dust went into my ears

372
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:56,630
What? Don't act smart

373
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,340
What are you upto since yesterday?

374
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,510
- No nothing.
- Why aren't you looking at me?

375
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,510
- I am looking at you.
- Why aren't you looking properly?

376
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,760
Yesterday you had braids in your
hair wearing a multicolour dress...

377
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,920
today you are in a suit with open hair,
how else do you want me to look at you?

378
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:13,630
I am noticing this since yesterday

379
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:16,470
Why are you putting your
head down the moment I come across?

380
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,970
Why can't you look into my eyes?

381
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,340
- I am looking.
- Madhu!

382
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,720
My dad asked me to stay away from you

383
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:33,970
What happened?

384
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,090
No nothing...

385
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,760
You are an idealistic child!

386
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,630
One who agrees whatever his dad says!

387
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,720
He made me swear on him,
what could have I done!

388
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:45,840
Then why are you following me now?
Don't follow me

389
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,380
You already forgot your dad's advice?

390
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,130
Parthavi I'll convince him,
Parthavi sorry

391
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,380
Sorry?

392
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,970
You know what, make a sorry-boat
and throw it in the lake

393
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,260
Now I don't want to talk to you

394
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,920
She is not responding
to my apology what can I do?

395
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
Go like Brad Pitt and tell her...

396
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,470
O love of my life!
your lover is searching for you...

397
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,840
Hey, stop giving rubbish idea
Sit down

398
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,130
He is at least giving me an idea

399
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:22,340
You, on the other hand,
want to just end my love story

400
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,050
Witch!

401
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,130
Treacherous!

402
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:24,760
Stupid!

403
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,510
Shut up

404
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,920
I have an idea

405
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:34,880
Lets send a kid to say sorry,
then she won't be able to ignore

406
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:36,470
what kid!

407
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,760
Kid!

408
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,130
You want?

409
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:49,950
You are dressed-up as a kid?

410
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,590
Yes. Since there was
no budget for a real kid!

411
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,550
Okay, tell us why are you here?

412
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,630
Madhu is apologising

413
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,130
Why? what did he do?

414
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,800
Because he insulted you

415
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,050
So what if he insulted me?

416
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,090
Go and ask him, who am I to you?

417
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:13,800
Who am I to you!

418
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,670
Now what can I answer to this?

419
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:24,380
The entire universe is trying to tell you
mister, that you are one in a million my sister

420
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,050
Hey...

421
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,380
Are you crazy?

422
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:33,270
I got an idea. Let's go

423
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,560
Is she liking it?

424
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:16,800
Did she like it?

425
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:17,720
She loved it!

426
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,970
She hated it! Let's go

427
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,510
Five...

428
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,130
Six...

429
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,510
Four...

430
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,670
Five...

431
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,050
Six...

432
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:34,840
Four...

433
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,300
Go tell him

434
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,800
I don't want to go
I'm looking like an idiot

435
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,780
You are an idiot. Go now

436
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,670
Parthavi said your
dance is horrible

437
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,720
Answer her question
in a form of a song

438
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,250
Question is still the
same- who am I to you?

439
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:07,650
Even in a school frock
she is looking like Beyonce

440
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,670
One, two, one two three four...

441
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:30,670
How can I tell you why I love you,
I can't even if I try

442
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,920
My eyes express the
feelings of my heart to you...

443
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,850
It was no fun!

444
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:45,880
You know english right?

445
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:50,220
Sing an english song then,
in front of the whole college

446
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,720
English song! In front of everyone!

447
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,920
You know what,
my friends think you are a coward

448
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,800
Show some courage

449
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:08,510
Let's go

450
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,300
English song!

451
00:34:13,510 --> 00:34:14,670
What are you doing Madhu?

452
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,510
We will get bashed
if somebody see you.

453
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,840
Don't worry it's not a big thing

454
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:21,380
I have enough courage

455
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:23,510
Only the courage will stay

456
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:25,760
and your picture will be on
the wall with the garland on it

457
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:29,920
Call her

458
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,510
Can we go from there

459
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:35,340
Hello Ambika

460
00:34:35,970 --> 00:34:37,170
Purshottam here

461
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,510
Sorry disturbing you this time

462
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:42,800
I hope there are no
mosqitoes in your room

463
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:46,630
Listen you mosqitoe come to the point

464
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,550
Ambika just a request

465
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,590
Can you call Parthavi

466
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,510
What happened?

467
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,590
Parthavi, Madhu is at your
terrace right now

468
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,630
Go fast

469
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,260
What?

470
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,800
Hello!!

471
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,130
Hello...

472
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,550
Wow, you are very strong indeed

473
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,920
Strength is in my blood

474
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,170
I am not scared of anyone

475
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,590
Not scared of Roop also?

476
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,550
Why would one be scared of him?

477
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:58,380
He doesn't even look
like your family member

478
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,470
Was he adopted?

479
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:00,340
Shut up...

480
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,840
Don't talk non-sense

481
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,300
Sorry. Joking

482
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,840
Why have you come here?

483
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,050
Our class is going
for a picnic tomorrow

484
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:08,840
So?

485
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,130
So what! So you will
get your answer there.

486
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,720
Means?

487
00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:15,800
Means your english song is ready

488
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,800
You'll sing a Justin Bieber song?

489
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,090
Who Bieber?

490
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,630
Leave it.
What song are you going to sing?

491
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,800
I have made for you. A special one

492
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,130
Special?

493
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,170
Special

494
00:36:31,250 --> 00:36:32,420
Sing a line

495
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:33,920
Nooo....

496
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,090
The fruit of patience is sweet

497
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,300
I'll see you tomorrow

498
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:44,380
Bye

499
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:47,970
Roop...

500
00:36:53,150 --> 00:36:53,970
Good joke

501
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:54,970
Courageous!

502
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,090
Good morning

503
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:10,720
Presenting a song
for your entertainment...

504
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,260
In english

505
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,340
English or hindi it doesn't matter

506
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,920
A donkey will always remain a donkey

507
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,420
Your own face is like a buffalo

508
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,840
Don't you feel ashamed
by calling others a donkey?

509
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,140
One, two... One two three four

510
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:39,840
How do I tell you, how much
I love you, I will never be able to...

511
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,430
Heart is not stopping,
wants to do talking

512
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,920
please let it come and tell you...

513
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:52,590
You don't know... You don't know...

514
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,800
You don't know... you don't know...

515
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:15,120
How do I tell you, how much I
love you, I will never be able to...

516
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:29,860
Hello?

517
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:30,980
Give the phone to Parthavi

518
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,230
For you

519
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:32,980
Who is it?

520
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:33,780
Madhu

521
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:40,570
Hello?

522
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,860
Someone is looking sweet
while siping a soft drink

523
00:38:47,830 --> 00:38:49,440
Why did you call on Ambika's phone?

524
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,280
Give me your phone
number I'll call you

525
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:54,070
Oh really!
Aren't you getting too excited

526
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,730
Excited? Yes I am

527
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:01,440
Devi where are you?

528
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,730
Have you gone deaf?

529
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:08,690
Question one...

530
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:13,320
Explain the organisational
structure at the national level

531
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,820
state level and local level....

532
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:18,480
Second Question

533
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,980
evaluate the role of co-operatives...

534
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,030
evaluate...

535
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:24,820
Whose phone is it?

536
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:27,690
Ya tell me

537
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:29,230
Whose phone is it? Switch it off

538
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,070
Yes I am out for some important work
I'll come in half an hour

539
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,030
Hang up

540
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:38,030
Who? You handle it

541
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,190
I said hang up the phone now

542
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:42,900
Quiet

543
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:46,780
I am in college

544
00:39:47,610 --> 00:39:49,320
Yeah I am here to
teach someone a lesson

545
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,690
Stand up

546
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:52,730
I said, stand up

547
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:00,070
Don't you know phones
are not allowed in a classroom

548
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:04,150
What are you looking at me?

549
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:08,440
Give me the phone
and get out of the class

550
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:12,060
Give me the phone
and get out of the class

551
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:35,120
I am telling you sister,
send Madhu with me to Nagpur

552
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:37,320
- You know his dad will never agree
- Hey uncle!

553
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:40,570
See your son will have a long life
Here he is

554
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:43,980
I have told you right not
to touch my feet. Give me a hug

555
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:44,980
How are you?

556
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,320
All well

557
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,230
You liked the pant-shirt?

558
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,770
Very much, I wore it also

559
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,530
You stay here tonight.
Dad has gone to Jaipur for some work

560
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,860
If your dad comes to
know that I stayed here

561
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,320
it will be a world war in the house

562
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,320
Why? What is his problem with you?

563
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:00,440
I would have told
you if there was one!

564
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:05,030
You leave it. Get ready
and take me lake-side

565
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,900
- Okay?
- Okay fine

566
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,320
Mom tell Gokul that I'll be late

567
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,280
Slapping a teacher was wrong

568
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:14,900
Shut up and eat your food

569
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:18,150
Don't teach me what
needs to be done or not

570
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:20,530
Why did you go to college?

571
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,860
Devi called. It was some boy's matter

572
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,070
There is no such matter

573
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,230
Dad, Devi is lying

574
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,440
There are a lot of boys and girls in
college, so should I give up studies?

575
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:35,230
Parthavi!

576
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:38,690
Sir, college principal
has arrived to see you

577
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,320
Make him sit

578
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:52,280
Roop slapped a teacher
in front of an entire classroom

579
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,940
But I don't want to
stretch this issue now

580
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:03,570
Let Roop apologise and end the issue

581
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:12,150
What is the teacher's name?

582
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:14,190
Agnihotri sir

583
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,570
Roop, say sorry to Agnihotri sir

584
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,530
Say sorry

585
00:42:23,110 --> 00:42:24,230
Dad I don't want to say sorry

586
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,650
Election is near

587
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,610
don't stretch the issue pointlessly,
say sorry

588
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:33,360
Let me win this election once...

589
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:37,530
then I'll see who dares to come at my
mansion with a complain of my family

590
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:38,530
Say sorry

591
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,610
Sorry

592
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:43,110
Didn't you hear that?

593
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,690
Now leave

594
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,900
Your cheeks look
puffier than the dough

595
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,900
Missing her?

596
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:08,110
All because of your's
and dad's curses... Witch!

597
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,530
Madhu! Our sweethearts
have come outside

598
00:43:11,690 --> 00:43:12,530
Come fast

599
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,480
What?

600
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:15,070
Listen, don't go

601
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:16,980
My husband has gone
to Jaipur for some work

602
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,980
hence I am taking
care of the front desk

603
00:43:19,150 --> 00:43:20,760
Otherwise I usually
manage the kitchen

604
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,230
Very well aunty

605
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,440
This is my son, Madhukar

606
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:27,230
I know aunty. He is in my college

607
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:29,570
You never told me!

608
00:43:30,850 --> 00:43:32,690
Mom you have met her at the clinic

609
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:36,280
Anyway, Gokul is waiting
for you in the kitchen

610
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,900
Welcome. Bagla's Exotic View Cafe

611
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,820
You disappeared all of a sudden!

612
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:47,480
I was giving a city tour to my uncle

613
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:50,980
Okay tell me,
what is the famous dish over here?

614
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,280
Red meat with lentil, world best

615
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,150
Cold drink. It's cold

616
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,360
We didn't order it!

617
00:43:58,110 --> 00:43:59,610
It's from me, free

618
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:00,650
I don't want it

619
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,730
You take my order

620
00:44:04,780 --> 00:44:05,480
Tell me

621
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:11,570
9, 7...

622
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,190
5, 5...

623
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:17,530
2, 2...

624
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,530
These are just eight digits,
remaining?

625
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,650
I forgot the remaining digits...

626
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:35,610
Let's go Ambika

627
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:42,780
Parthavi!

628
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:47,650
This is my restaurant's visiting card

629
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,690
It has my phone number, personal

630
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,610
All ten digits

631
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:02,110
Ambika... my card...

632
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:06,230
Hey... Why did you
offer a free cold drink?

633
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:07,690
Is it your dad's property?

634
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,780
Dear, one must take care of his lady

635
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,320
That's also true!

636
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,320
Hey, what are you doing?

637
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:39,940
Let's go inside it's late night

638
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,070
I am going to sit here and chant
and make sure that the call comes

639
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,230
It will come right?

640
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:48,940
- 200%
- It won't

641
00:46:00,110 --> 00:46:01,030
Witch!

642
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:15,690
Hey... the call has come!

643
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:21,530
- It did come, it did come!
- Show show show...

644
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,980
What did you say? It won't come right?

645
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:26,900
See it's ringing

646
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,530
- Show show show...
- No I won't

647
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:35,360
Okay c'mon give now
- No I won't

648
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,700
Give, let me answer

649
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:44,540
Oh! Disconnected

650
00:47:02,730 --> 00:47:03,400
Hello?

651
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:04,980
Why didn't you receive
at the first place?

652
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:07,360
We were dancing in
delight of your phone call

653
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:09,900
No need to dance

654
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,400
Why didn't call you last night?

655
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,110
Was sleepy, so I slept!

656
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,820
Okay listen, I have to go the
temple with dad, I'll call you later

657
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:19,110
What?

658
00:47:22,030 --> 00:47:23,320
Okay I have to go now, bye.

659
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:17,610
Madhu!

660
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:21,190
I love you

661
00:49:26,610 --> 00:49:27,530
You also say

662
00:49:29,430 --> 00:49:30,610
I am feeling shy

663
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,570
Shy! I'll give you a tight slap

664
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:34,650
I love you...

665
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:36,940
What?

666
00:49:37,120 --> 00:49:38,230
I love you too

667
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:29,030
Moments ago the police has
raided the Goenka Palace hotel...

668
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,900
...and seized a huge amount of
fake currency, fake liquor and drugs

669
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:35,150
This hotel belongs to the
ruling party MLA Sulekha Goenka

670
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:37,280
But Sulekha's supporters
are accusing...

671
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:39,230
Ratan Singh of a political
conspiracy in this matter

672
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:41,150
You have done a great job

673
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:44,230
Hang on I am giving the phone to dad

674
00:51:46,030 --> 00:51:47,730
Dad, Inspector

675
00:51:52,030 --> 00:51:55,190
Mr Shekhawat, you nailed it

676
00:51:55,270 --> 00:51:56,860
It calls for a treat Mr Ratan

677
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:58,730
C'mon guys hurry up

678
00:51:58,820 --> 00:52:01,320
After this whole incident
ahead of the assembly elections

679
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,250
it is quite clear that
Mr Ratan's side is heavier then ever

680
00:52:21,590 --> 00:52:23,920
One day I will build
a big mansion for you

681
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,380
Bigger then yours

682
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:33,720
I don't want a mansion

683
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:42,670
I am in a big mansion since childhood

684
00:52:47,970 --> 00:52:49,920
But that wasn't mine ever!

685
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:55,050
It is a hotel

686
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,760
I want a home

687
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,720
Our home

688
00:53:06,190 --> 00:53:08,800
Where food will be
cooked for only both of us

689
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,260
not for the world

690
00:53:15,090 --> 00:53:19,360
So... you take your big mansion
and throw it in the lake

691
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,800
I don't need it

692
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:27,560
So who will cook in the new house,
you or me?

693
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:31,380
You. And make it calorie
free I want to stay slim

694
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,720
Really!

695
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:43,170
I want a pappi (kiss)...

696
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:50,880
Puppy? You mean a dog's baby?

697
00:53:53,510 --> 00:53:55,220
Pappi means kiss

698
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,840
Kiss?

699
00:53:58,380 --> 00:53:59,760
You want a kiss?

700
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:03,220
Take it then

701
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:05,630
Shall I?

702
00:54:10,670 --> 00:54:12,240
Come to the mansion and take it

703
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:16,470
Don't crack such jokes

704
00:54:17,380 --> 00:54:18,420
I am not cracking jokes

705
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:21,130
Tomorrow is Roop's birthday,
come if you have any courage left!

706
00:54:21,510 --> 00:54:23,510
What do you mean courage left?
I have come there before

707
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:24,800
Everyone was sleeping then

708
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,380
If I come then you'll
have to give the kiss!

709
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,420
You'll come?

710
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,340
I will come for sure

711
00:54:30,670 --> 00:54:31,720
Okay you come first

712
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:35,590
Parthavi I will come

713
00:54:36,170 --> 00:54:36,970
Parthavi

714
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:38,840
Bye

715
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,510
Bye

716
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,420
Have you forgotten your status?

717
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:07,510
How dare you love my sister?

718
01:00:07,590 --> 01:00:09,630
Roop...

719
01:00:10,170 --> 01:00:11,220
Stop it!

720
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:12,010
Two days

721
01:00:12,090 --> 01:00:13,130
Just wait for two days

722
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:17,480
It's two days for the election
then I'll personally thrash them

723
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:39,630
What happened?

724
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:43,260
What did you do?

725
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,720
I told you to stay away from her

726
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:51,170
I told you

727
01:00:52,380 --> 01:00:53,800
Those are upper-caste people

728
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,170
I told you to stay away

729
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,260
Please listen...

730
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,590
Why don't you ever listen to me!

731
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,760
Long live Ratan Singh!

732
01:01:26,840 --> 01:01:28,170
- Vote for...
- Ratan Singh!

733
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,380
Long live Ratan Singh!

734
01:01:30,470 --> 01:01:34,050
- Vote for...
- Ratan Singh!

735
01:01:34,130 --> 01:01:37,380
Long live Ratan Singh!

736
01:01:39,420 --> 01:01:40,260
Eat something

737
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:43,870
A little bit, please

738
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,260
Don't be like this Parthavi

739
01:01:49,630 --> 01:01:50,920
He is alright

740
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,340
How is she?

741
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,420
They have locked her in a room

742
01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,510
She doesn't even have a phone

743
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:26,840
Not allowing you also?

744
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:28,170
No

745
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,920
You take care

746
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:38,600
Come, let's leave...

747
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,550
And with a lead of 2000 votes,
Mr Ratan Singh...

748
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:43,500
has defeated Sulekha
and won the assembly election

749
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:49,380
Long live Ratan Singh!

750
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:21,260
[indisctinct chatter]

751
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,920
[indisctinct chatter]

752
01:03:31,970 --> 01:03:40,920
[indisctinct chatter]

753
01:03:51,090 --> 01:04:01,720
[indisctinct chatter]

754
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:04,170
Whatever you wished,
will be done now

755
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,380
Have some tea

756
01:04:53,150 --> 01:04:56,710
Don't take any tension Mr Ratan, the
job will be done. You go and relax

757
01:04:57,550 --> 01:04:58,670
Start the car

758
01:04:58,760 --> 01:04:59,800
Madhu!

759
01:05:01,720 --> 01:05:03,670
Leave him...

760
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,170
- Parthavi!
- Madhu!

761
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:06,720
Parthavi leave

762
01:05:09,550 --> 01:05:11,970
Dad please leave him please

763
01:05:12,050 --> 01:05:13,050
Take her away

764
01:05:13,220 --> 01:05:14,950
What are you doing here?

765
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,210
You listen to me child

766
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:25,190
Please release them...they will never
ever come near me, please leave them...

767
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,550
Ya, we'll leave them

768
01:05:26,630 --> 01:05:29,720
Dad he will leave the city for ever

769
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,140
Don't worry, I'll take care of them

770
01:05:31,220 --> 01:05:32,970
We won't do anything, okay?

771
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,340
Parthavi I'll kill you

772
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:38,340
I'll kill myself dad

773
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:39,470
- I'll shoot myself.
- No... no... no...

774
01:05:39,550 --> 01:05:40,760
Let them go

775
01:05:40,840 --> 01:05:42,050
Madhu let's go

776
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:43,510
I've released them, calm down

777
01:05:43,590 --> 01:05:44,470
Stay back

778
01:05:44,950 --> 01:05:48,330
No one will move a step
Come in front and stay there

779
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,730
Stay right there

780
01:06:15,130 --> 01:06:18,160
Madhu....
Gokul look where is he going?

781
01:06:18,470 --> 01:06:20,740
You come here

782
01:06:23,760 --> 01:06:26,150
Stop... stop...

783
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,720
Did you see them anywhere?

784
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,130
Where the hell are they?

785
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:31,800
You check there

786
01:06:31,940 --> 01:06:33,550
Devi, you go that side

787
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,840
Let's go

788
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,670
Drive straight...

789
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:00,430
Over there

790
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:38,050
Parthavi stop

791
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,970
Madhu stop, Parthavi stop.

792
01:09:56,170 --> 01:09:57,220
Parthavi

793
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,800
Stop the train

794
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:02,630
Stop them

795
01:10:12,010 --> 01:10:13,010
Stop the train

796
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,630
Check where is the train going

797
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,340
Quickly

798
01:10:19,010 --> 01:10:20,110
Parthavi

799
01:12:02,050 --> 01:12:02,840
20 Rupees

800
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:05,800
I don't have money

801
01:12:11,260 --> 01:12:11,840
Get lost

802
01:13:23,630 --> 01:13:24,550
Hello?

803
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:25,630
Uncle

804
01:13:26,380 --> 01:13:28,170
Madhu where are you?

805
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:29,840
In Mumbai

806
01:13:31,050 --> 01:13:32,380
Listen, your mom called

807
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:34,170
She was very tensed

808
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:35,590
What are you doing Madhu?

809
01:13:36,470 --> 01:13:38,170
I don't know uncle

810
01:13:40,940 --> 01:13:41,920
I am very scared

811
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:43,420
Firstly stop crying

812
01:13:43,970 --> 01:13:44,880
do you have some money?

813
01:13:46,310 --> 01:13:47,220
do you have some money?

814
01:13:48,050 --> 01:13:48,760
Ya I have some

815
01:13:48,840 --> 01:13:52,300
Ok then, buy a ticket
for a Nagpur bus and come here

816
01:13:52,470 --> 01:13:55,010
And listen, do not call anyone at all

817
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:56,840
Ok uncle

818
01:13:56,920 --> 01:13:57,420
Note down my address

819
01:13:57,510 --> 01:13:58,220
Yes uncle

820
01:14:44,180 --> 01:14:45,670
Any information on Madhu's friends?

821
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:47,420
Cops are looking for them everywhere,
we'll know something sooner

822
01:14:47,510 --> 01:14:49,050
Then why are you faffing here,
go search for them

823
01:14:49,130 --> 01:14:49,800
Roop brother...

824
01:14:54,670 --> 01:14:55,800
Go inside

825
01:14:58,340 --> 01:14:59,800
Can't you hear?

826
01:15:00,260 --> 01:15:01,220
Go inside!

827
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:12,010
Mr Ratan

828
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,670
Many congratulations

829
01:15:16,430 --> 01:15:19,420
Your lifelong desire is fulfilled

830
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,760
It will be a pleasure
to sit in your opposition

831
01:15:26,010 --> 01:15:28,970
You are a real image
of an ideal Udaipur family

832
01:15:30,970 --> 01:15:32,380
Your daughter is nowhere to be seen!

833
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:35,550
She ran away

834
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,670
So the rumour is true

835
01:15:42,220 --> 01:15:43,630
But you don't worry

836
01:15:44,300 --> 01:15:45,970
I won't tell anything to anyone

837
01:15:48,090 --> 01:15:49,420
I am just like you

838
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,050
I also don't like spoiling
the opposition's reputation

839
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:59,840
You are not like me Mrs Sulekha

840
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:06,170
I will kill my daughter
the day I find her

841
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:12,610
So get habitual of
sitting in the opposition

842
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:57,800
Come

843
01:16:58,630 --> 01:17:00,130
Take a shower first

844
01:17:04,220 --> 01:17:08,130
Are you even aware what
would be the situation there?

845
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,030
Her family will make
everyone's life hell

846
01:17:14,910 --> 01:17:16,510
And your dad is no lesser

847
01:17:16,590 --> 01:17:18,170
You don't know him yet!

848
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,180
I was like a son to him

849
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:27,510
But just because I did
an inter-caste marriage...

850
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,430
he put an end to all our relations

851
01:17:30,510 --> 01:17:33,630
Neither did he come to my wedding...

852
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,920
nor has he spoken to me ever since

853
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:41,010
And both of you are not that naive!

854
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,300
I do understand love, but what
you guys have done is foolishness

855
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:47,010
Understood?

856
01:17:47,550 --> 01:17:49,130
Where are they going to stay now?

857
01:17:49,460 --> 01:17:52,170
Don't dump them on my head,
I am telling you clearly!

858
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:55,050
Come, have dinner

859
01:17:55,860 --> 01:17:56,800
Come

860
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:01,840
They will look for you everywhere now.

861
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:05,840
They might come here too

862
01:18:08,260 --> 01:18:09,800
No one is safe now

863
01:18:10,550 --> 01:18:11,470
Neither you

864
01:18:13,220 --> 01:18:14,170
nor us

865
01:18:37,490 --> 01:18:40,220
I have a friend in Kolkata,
his name is Sachin Bhowmick

866
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:44,590
I have spoken to him,
he will do some arrangements

867
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:47,510
Uncle, Kolkata?

868
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:49,170
Don't be scared Madhu

869
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:52,210
He is a very good friend of mine...

870
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,310
and he owns a hostel

871
01:18:55,510 --> 01:18:57,510
He will arrange a room for you in it

872
01:18:57,590 --> 01:19:01,350
I anyway visit there once in a year,
I'll meet you then

873
01:19:03,130 --> 01:19:05,700
Can't we stay here with you?

874
01:19:06,050 --> 01:19:10,340
Madhu try to understand,
you guys are safe there

875
01:19:11,180 --> 01:19:12,880
No one will get to know about you

876
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:17,810
and anyway your aunt is
due to deliver a baby next month

877
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,460
I don't want to give her any tension

878
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:22,220
Are you getting me?

879
01:19:24,920 --> 01:19:26,340
Can't we think of something else?

880
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:29,920
I don't want to go to Kolkata,
I don't want to go alone

881
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:30,670
Please

882
01:19:32,090 --> 01:19:32,920
please uncle

883
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:36,380
Uncle, will we ever be
able to go back to Udaipur?

884
01:19:37,470 --> 01:19:39,260
Can't say when, but...

885
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:42,840
it will take some time for sure

886
01:20:33,410 --> 01:20:37,250
Yes there is a room available,
but would be slightly messy

887
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:40,390
- I didn't get time to get it cleaned
- I am taking the taxi sir

888
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:43,770
Hey, get the petrol
bill and drive properly

889
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:48,260
Arvind told me that he
will send two month's rent

890
01:20:48,340 --> 01:20:50,460
But after that you'll have to pay

891
01:20:51,300 --> 01:20:54,770
Hey Promila, tenants have arrived,
show them the room

892
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,480
And no ruckus...

893
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:59,000
if I get a complaint
then you'll have to vacate

894
01:21:01,820 --> 01:21:04,330
Can't you show them the room?

895
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:06,050
Are you stuck to the chair?

896
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:09,940
I am getting late for work,
you show them

897
01:21:10,340 --> 01:21:11,680
Useless person

898
01:21:14,300 --> 01:21:14,970
My wife!

899
01:21:15,940 --> 01:21:18,020
she is late for work, that's why

900
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:20,510
Come, I'll only show you the room

901
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:25,140
See, this is the common toilet

902
01:21:25,960 --> 01:21:28,130
Hey your last three
month's rent is pending

903
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:29,880
Yes sir, I'll pay next week

904
01:21:29,970 --> 01:21:30,970
Ok fine

905
01:21:31,550 --> 01:21:33,800
Whoever stays on this floor,
uses this toilet-bathroom

906
01:21:33,880 --> 01:21:34,550
Hello sir

907
01:21:34,710 --> 01:21:35,510
Hello

908
01:21:36,090 --> 01:21:36,550
Let's go

909
01:21:50,470 --> 01:21:52,010
Let's go Parthavi

910
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:53,380
Come...

911
01:22:01,630 --> 01:22:02,670
This is your room

912
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:07,760
Whatever stuff you don't need,
keep it outside

913
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:09,660
I will later get
it moved to the godown

914
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:16,340
Broom and mop are here,
you can clean your room

915
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,310
Parthavi...

916
01:22:42,310 --> 01:22:46,290
You clean the dust, rest I'll manage

917
01:23:39,870 --> 01:23:45,220
I have written down the hotel manager's
phone number & address on this...

918
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,590
you go and meet him once

919
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,970
I have spoken to him,
he will arrange some job for you

920
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:50,800
Thank you Sir...

921
01:23:50,880 --> 01:23:54,640
Again sir! Call me brother

922
01:23:55,620 --> 01:23:56,430
Thank you brother

923
01:24:01,860 --> 01:24:03,680
- What happened?
- Lizard!

924
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:05,850
Shoo her away Madhu

925
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:07,050
Why are you screaming!

926
01:24:07,130 --> 01:24:08,260
Lizard!

927
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:09,420
Where is she?

928
01:24:09,660 --> 01:24:10,800
Behind the cupboard

929
01:24:16,670 --> 01:24:18,590
Madhu check properly

930
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,090
She got scared of you and ran away

931
01:24:21,170 --> 01:24:22,300
What do you mean?

932
01:24:22,380 --> 01:24:23,170
Madhu check properly

933
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:24,920
- There is no lizard, come
- No

934
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,630
- I am here, come
- No I don't want to come

935
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,210
- I am with you, come
- No

936
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:30,880
Why are you scared? Come

937
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:34,220
Lizard!

938
01:24:48,030 --> 01:24:49,110
Where are you going?

939
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,360
To look for work

940
01:24:54,760 --> 01:24:55,820
Don't go

941
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,610
- Parthavi why are you scared?
- Please don't leave me and go

942
01:24:59,690 --> 01:25:00,650
I'll be back soon

943
01:25:01,780 --> 01:25:03,150
I'll also come with you then

944
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:06,940
I'll be back in no time

945
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:09,110
I am anyway getting late

946
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:11,400
You wash clothes by then

947
01:25:12,860 --> 01:25:14,470
Otherwise we'll have
to roam around naked

948
01:25:15,960 --> 01:25:16,650
Okay?

949
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:18,490
I'll be right back

950
01:25:28,060 --> 01:25:30,040
You don't have an ID card

951
01:25:30,770 --> 01:25:33,090
you can't speak Bengali

952
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:35,500
how can I give you a job?

953
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:38,920
I will learn Bengali
sir and I can cook good food

954
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:40,900
I had a restaurant in Udaipur

955
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:42,860
I can cook all types
of Rajasthani dishes

956
01:25:43,540 --> 01:25:47,120
I don't need a cook,
there is no vacancy for a cook

957
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:51,040
Sir you can give me any job then

958
01:25:51,170 --> 01:25:54,380
mopping, sweeping, washing utensils,
waiter, I can do anything

959
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:55,790
Please

960
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:04,460
Ok I'll think about
it and will let Sachin know

961
01:26:05,290 --> 01:26:06,130
You can go now

962
01:26:06,290 --> 01:26:08,250
I'll let you know. Okay?

963
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:09,250
Fine

964
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:11,880
Thank you sir

965
01:26:44,000 --> 01:26:45,000
You have learned!

966
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:49,080
Parthavi

967
01:26:50,580 --> 01:26:51,790
I have spoiled everything

968
01:26:53,070 --> 01:26:53,800
Not at all!

969
01:26:54,790 --> 01:26:57,550
These are small stains,
they will go in one more wash

970
01:27:03,920 --> 01:27:05,170
They won't go

971
01:27:07,250 --> 01:27:10,370
They will have to!
I will make them go, don't worry

972
01:27:12,470 --> 01:27:13,670
You want to see Kolkata?

973
01:27:14,920 --> 01:27:16,910
- No?
- I don't want to go

974
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:22,040
Get ready, lets go see the city

975
01:27:25,700 --> 01:27:27,000
Ok, I'll go alone then

976
01:27:27,150 --> 01:27:27,830
No!

977
01:28:15,540 --> 01:28:16,940
Milk!

978
01:28:18,880 --> 01:28:21,990
You seriously don't drink any alcohol?

979
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:23,920
No brother

980
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:27,130
Nice, milk is also nice

981
01:28:28,790 --> 01:28:31,760
I used to drink rum earlier

982
01:28:33,670 --> 01:28:40,470
Then Promila said wine
is the world's best drink

983
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:45,430
hence I started drinking wine

984
01:28:47,100 --> 01:28:48,790
But I miss rum

985
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:57,840
Did you meet that manager?

986
01:28:58,060 --> 01:28:59,210
- Yes
- What did he say?

987
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:00,630
I met him today

988
01:29:00,890 --> 01:29:02,490
He said he'll let me know later

989
01:29:03,510 --> 01:29:06,670
He will do something I am sure

990
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:08,130
Don't worry I'll talk to him again

991
01:29:08,390 --> 01:29:09,370
Hey listen...

992
01:29:09,990 --> 01:29:10,630
Ya

993
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:12,650
let him go to his girl

994
01:29:12,830 --> 01:29:15,000
don't make him a drunkard like you

995
01:29:15,460 --> 01:29:17,210
And we have to go to
church tomorrow morning

996
01:29:17,290 --> 01:29:17,960
Enough for tonight

997
01:29:19,270 --> 01:29:19,910
See...

998
01:29:20,710 --> 01:29:22,750
I have just started
and she is saying enough!

999
01:29:28,480 --> 01:29:29,230
See this

1000
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:31,920
Sweet curd

1001
01:29:33,610 --> 01:29:35,240
Sachin brother has sent for you

1002
01:29:55,490 --> 01:29:56,240
Have it

1003
01:29:57,030 --> 01:29:57,950
I don't want to

1004
01:29:58,990 --> 01:30:00,000
- Have some at least
- No

1005
01:30:00,080 --> 01:30:01,170
One spoon

1006
01:30:10,580 --> 01:30:11,420
Not good?

1007
01:30:23,210 --> 01:30:24,040
It is good

1008
01:30:24,710 --> 01:30:25,420
Liar

1009
01:30:34,130 --> 01:30:37,920
And him who comes to
me I will not caste out

1010
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:39,990
I am the bread of life

1011
01:30:40,410 --> 01:30:42,960
this is the bread which
comes down from heaven

1012
01:30:43,350 --> 01:30:45,130
and the bread which I shall give

1013
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:48,670
for the life of the world is my flesh

1014
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,960
Amen

1015
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,390
We usually buy grocery
from this store

1016
01:30:53,980 --> 01:30:57,130
Brother,
please open an account for her too

1017
01:30:57,210 --> 01:30:58,260
Keep this too

1018
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:02,290
I've got your account open here,
if you need anything, call me

1019
01:31:02,380 --> 01:31:03,790
You'll go home alone, right?

1020
01:31:03,880 --> 01:31:06,080
Ok then, I am getting late. See you

1021
01:31:13,150 --> 01:31:15,630
Let me wash the utensils at least
He will do any job

1022
01:31:15,710 --> 01:31:18,000
He is a nice guy,
I am taking his guarantee personally

1023
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:20,280
It's not possible here

1024
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:24,630
Try in one of the sports club,
it will be better for him

1025
01:31:24,710 --> 01:31:28,540
Brother you know how tough
it is to get into a sports club!

1026
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:31,000
You please keep him
for a job at your hotel

1027
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:33,290
And if he messes around
anything then fire him

1028
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:36,220
Did you hear that? No mistakes
otherwise he will fire you

1029
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:37,200
Yes brother

1030
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,790
Kick him out

1031
01:31:44,130 --> 01:31:45,170
Done

1032
01:31:45,580 --> 01:31:47,320
You'll get Rs. 5000 per month

1033
01:31:47,690 --> 01:31:50,260
It's ok for now,
you will get an increment gradually

1034
01:31:51,290 --> 01:31:52,460
You can speak English right?

1035
01:31:52,540 --> 01:31:53,340
Yes brother

1036
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:55,060
Good

1037
01:31:55,670 --> 01:31:59,380
now quickly learn Bengali too,
then see you'll become a local hero!

1038
01:32:30,830 --> 01:32:34,540
You attend them
I'll just see you, excuse me

1039
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,330
Hello?

1040
01:32:42,210 --> 01:32:42,920
Hello?

1041
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:55,790
Hello?

1042
01:33:35,830 --> 01:33:37,390
You are a hidden talent!

1043
01:33:43,710 --> 01:33:47,540
I don't want to stay here Madhu,
I don't want to stay here!

1044
01:33:48,310 --> 01:33:50,170
I want to go back to Udaipur

1045
01:33:50,390 --> 01:33:51,930
I miss my home

1046
01:33:55,070 --> 01:33:57,420
I am missing mom alot

1047
01:33:58,790 --> 01:34:01,580
Madhu please take me back...

1048
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:03,210
Everything will be fine Parthavi

1049
01:34:03,290 --> 01:34:04,970
Nothing will be fine

1050
01:34:06,550 --> 01:34:07,500
I am telling you,
everything will be fine

1051
01:34:07,580 --> 01:34:08,750
When?

1052
01:34:08,830 --> 01:34:10,000
How do I know?

1053
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,890
Everything will be fine

1054
01:34:51,230 --> 01:34:52,630
Parthavi,
I think you should also get a job

1055
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:53,950
I don't want to

1056
01:34:57,050 --> 01:34:59,680
- You will feel good...
- There is no need of feeling any good

1057
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:03,930
We'll get some more money also

1058
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:22,530
Could you please take off my clothes
also from the rope once they are dry

1059
01:35:24,130 --> 01:35:27,170
Could you please take off my clothes
also from the rope once they are dry

1060
01:35:48,660 --> 01:35:51,060
You know english,
that is an advantage

1061
01:35:51,520 --> 01:35:54,580
Once you'll get this job,
it will be good for you

1062
01:35:54,790 --> 01:35:58,120
Otherwise you'll get depressed
all day sitting at home alone

1063
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,350
I have already spoken
to Vishwajeet sir

1064
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:06,880
Come Promila

1065
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,460
Hi, Vishwajeet

- Parthavi
- Have a seat

1067
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:22,190
Sir, I am summoned daily
since last six months

1068
01:36:23,420 --> 01:36:25,350
My restaurant is about to shut

1069
01:36:27,170 --> 01:36:28,580
Please forgive me

1070
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:32,960
What should I do if your
restaurant is shutting down?

1071
01:36:33,820 --> 01:36:34,730
Where is Madhu?

1072
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:37,620
I don't know where is he,
I have told you thousand times

1073
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,210
Don't misbehave in front of sir

1074
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,060
Don't raise your voice

1075
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:46,500
Bring him again tomorrow
at 11 in the morning

1076
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:49,040
Understood? Don't even
try to raise your voice again

1077
01:36:49,220 --> 01:36:51,560
C'mon get up now. Leave

1078
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,960
And two fish-rice...

1079
01:36:55,150 --> 01:36:57,170
Sir banana gravy is our speciality

1080
01:36:57,540 --> 01:36:59,170
would you like to have that?

1081
01:37:00,740 --> 01:37:01,710
Ok, I'll have one

1082
01:37:01,790 --> 01:37:03,230
One banana gravy

1083
01:37:04,320 --> 01:37:05,080
Ok sir

1084
01:37:08,460 --> 01:37:09,170
Thank you

1085
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:12,460
Madhu, come here

1086
01:37:13,460 --> 01:37:14,210
Come

1087
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:16,460
Yes sir

1088
01:37:16,670 --> 01:37:19,080
You have learned to speak Bengali!

1089
01:37:19,850 --> 01:37:20,800
Yes sir

1090
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:22,550
A little

1091
01:37:22,910 --> 01:37:25,710
I still need
more practice though

1092
01:37:25,790 --> 01:37:27,670
Yes, keep practicing

1093
01:37:30,360 --> 01:37:32,130
Sir, can I have Rs.3000 in advance?

1094
01:37:33,550 --> 01:37:35,690
You are very smart

1095
01:37:36,540 --> 01:37:37,890
Very smart!

1096
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:41,880
You convince me for
everything by saying sir sir...

1097
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:43,540
No sir, actually I need it

1098
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,600
Ok you'll get it, go work now

1099
01:37:45,680 --> 01:37:46,460
Thank you sir

1100
01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:59,200
Good Morning sir. This is Parthavi

Actually this is very famous here

1111
01:38:28,580 --> 01:38:29,750
It's spicy

1112
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:32,380
Give me one more

1113
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:40,920

01:39:25,720 --> 01:39:26,460
Hello?

1117
01:39:43,690 --> 01:39:44,500
Dad

1118
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:50,020
Are you alright?

1119
01:40:01,790 --> 01:40:03,150
Don't call ever again

1120
01:40:38,800 --> 01:40:41,680
Listen, withdraw some money tomorrow

1121
01:40:41,760 --> 01:40:43,490
Have to pay the rent

1122
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,140
Madhu

1123
01:40:52,020 --> 01:40:52,910
Madhu

1124
01:40:58,050 --> 01:40:59,020
What happened?

1125
01:41:01,290 --> 01:41:05,050
Anything happened at the restaurant?

1126
01:41:07,790 --> 01:41:08,580
What happened?

1127
01:41:13,940 --> 01:41:14,990
Say something

1128
01:41:15,580 --> 01:41:16,920
Why are you asking me?

1129
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:19,690
Go ask the person you
were having snacks with!

1130
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:25,230
You came to office today?

1131
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:27,510
Yes

1132
01:41:29,170 --> 01:41:30,890
And got this new phone for you

1133
01:41:33,990 --> 01:41:35,460
Then why didn't you meet me?

1134
01:41:36,330 --> 01:41:38,020
You were busy with your boss

1135
01:41:43,050 --> 01:41:44,850
Madhu don't talk rubbish

1136
01:41:46,580 --> 01:41:47,880
I am talking rubbish?

1137
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:50,810
Weren't you having
snacks with your boss?

1138
01:41:51,370 --> 01:41:54,290
Ya, but was I the only one having it?
Everyone was there

1139
01:41:54,510 --> 01:41:56,290
- But he was glued to you only
- Madhu

1140
01:41:56,550 --> 01:41:57,620
- Why are you talking like this?
- What?

1141
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:58,930
How am I talking?

1142
01:41:59,700 --> 01:42:00,390
Tell me!

1143
01:42:02,510 --> 01:42:03,630
Why are you getting angry?

1144
01:42:03,860 --> 01:42:04,690
Why shouldn't I get angry?

1145
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:06,880
Why do you want to fight Madhu?

1146
01:42:07,870 --> 01:42:09,210
- Let's talk
- Madhu

1147
01:42:09,290 --> 01:42:11,170
Hey Madhu

1148
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,800
Parthavi, Madhu

1149
01:42:13,000 --> 01:42:15,080
Hey Madhu

1150
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:20,070
Hey Madhu

1151
01:42:25,000 --> 01:42:25,890
Hey I am also here

1152
01:42:26,370 --> 01:42:27,210
Leave him

1153
01:42:29,370 --> 01:42:30,760
My brother

1154
01:42:35,590 --> 01:42:36,920
How are you Madhu?

1155
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:37,710
How are you Purshottom?

1156
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:38,850
Fine

1157
01:42:41,750 --> 01:42:42,330
How are you?

1158
01:42:42,420 --> 01:42:43,370
Your hair style has changed!

1159
01:42:43,460 --> 01:42:45,030
I missed you a lot

1160
01:42:49,590 --> 01:42:51,330
- Sachin brother
- Yes

1161
01:42:51,710 --> 01:42:55,460
These are my friends. Best friends

1162
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:57,330
He looks like your child

1163
01:42:59,120 --> 01:43:01,190
- Hello
- Let's go upstairs

1164
01:43:01,370 --> 01:43:04,560
I spoke to Arvind uncle,
he told us that you guys are here

1165
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:06,120
so we came directly

1166
01:43:07,600 --> 01:43:10,080
Have some fresh sweets quickly

1167
01:43:10,300 --> 01:43:11,040
Take

1168
01:43:11,270 --> 01:43:13,460
It's been three days since we left
from Banaras, are they still fresh?

1169
01:43:13,540 --> 01:43:15,750
So! They are from my shop,
obviously I know the quality!

1170
01:43:15,830 --> 01:43:17,080
You are the owner of the shop?

1171
01:43:17,390 --> 01:43:18,500
Ya... owner!

1172
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:19,520
What?

1173
01:43:20,020 --> 01:43:21,790
His job is to shoo
flies from the sweets

1174
01:43:22,660 --> 01:43:23,790
This is the truth

1175
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,170
It is the most important job

1176
01:43:25,250 --> 01:43:25,670
How?

1177
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:28,450
- A single fly can cause malaria
- That's true

1178
01:43:28,630 --> 01:43:33,030
Hey, malaria happens
due to mosquito idiot

1179
01:43:37,930 --> 01:43:39,190
Rest everything is fine bro

1180
01:43:39,660 --> 01:43:44,430
We both work on the same shop,
we have a small place to stay

1181
01:43:45,900 --> 01:43:47,300
Everything is perfect

1182
01:43:47,860 --> 01:43:48,830
Got a chance to visit Udaipur?

1183
01:43:50,750 --> 01:43:51,450
No

1184
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:54,870
There is no chance of going back now

1185
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:59,360
Mr Ratan is in power and
anyway there is so much tension

1186
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:07,060
Sorry

1187
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:09,150
Why are you saying sorry?

1188
01:44:09,490 --> 01:44:10,430
Let her say

1189
01:44:11,840 --> 01:44:13,400
Because of them we all are here today

1190
01:44:13,970 --> 01:44:14,810
Why shouldn't she apologise?

1191
01:44:23,680 --> 01:44:25,790
I'll keep the sweets upstairs and come

1192
01:45:00,680 --> 01:45:04,320
Sachin brother,
can I get a glass of wine?

1193
01:45:04,910 --> 01:45:07,040
You are my real darling

1194
01:45:07,250 --> 01:45:10,290
Good, you are at least
giving me a company

1195
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:14,520
otherwise in few months I would
have started drinking milk like this

1196
01:45:15,500 --> 01:45:17,230
Wait I'll get you a glass

1197
01:45:17,730 --> 01:45:19,040
Hey Promila...

1198
01:45:22,030 --> 01:45:23,250
No... I'll get it

1199
01:45:23,540 --> 01:45:24,540
Carefully

1200
01:45:28,860 --> 01:45:29,520
Hey

1201
01:45:30,860 --> 01:45:32,460
since when have
you started drinking?

1202
01:45:33,890 --> 01:45:38,480
I drink some times while
thinking about Ambika

1203
01:46:26,370 --> 01:46:28,190
- You want more?
- No thanks

1204
01:46:30,750 --> 01:46:32,070
- Brother?
- Yes

1205
01:46:33,080 --> 01:46:35,750
Can I ask
you a personal question?

1206
01:46:35,930 --> 01:46:37,180
Yes, ask

1207
01:46:38,120 --> 01:46:39,370
You don't have kids?

1208
01:46:39,680 --> 01:46:41,470
Hey... medical problem

1209
01:46:42,370 --> 01:46:43,580
No no

1210
01:46:45,400 --> 01:46:47,430
There is no medical problem

1211
01:46:48,240 --> 01:46:52,990
In fact our society is
no more a good place to live

1212
01:46:55,080 --> 01:46:59,110
It's tough to even breathe
peacefully in today's time

1213
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:03,970
Take your example...

1214
01:47:04,760 --> 01:47:11,730
You both are innocent but still...

1215
01:47:13,460 --> 01:47:15,960
running away
from your families

1216
01:47:16,360 --> 01:47:19,000
away from your home, your city

1217
01:47:20,050 --> 01:47:25,530
Then why should we bring a child
in this world to make him suffer

1218
01:47:39,540 --> 01:47:40,510
Parthavi

1219
01:47:48,260 --> 01:47:50,150
I want to talk to you

1220
01:47:54,130 --> 01:47:57,900
Then you should have,
I was here the whole evening

1221
01:48:01,160 --> 01:48:03,910
Sleep now,
I have to go to office tomorrow

1222
01:48:11,520 --> 01:48:14,570
Jesus said, I am the bread of life

1223
01:48:14,650 --> 01:48:17,560
he who comes to me, shall not hunger

1224
01:48:17,770 --> 01:48:20,170
- and he who believes in me
- Bro, have you converted your religion?

1225
01:48:20,250 --> 01:48:21,620
shall never thirst

1226
01:48:22,120 --> 01:48:25,250
but i said to you,
that you have seen me

1227
01:48:25,330 --> 01:48:27,760
and yet do not believe

1228
01:48:28,090 --> 01:48:31,170
all that the father
gives me, will come to me...

1229
01:48:31,250 --> 01:48:33,230
- Today I'll show you a Bengali film
- What?

1230
01:48:33,540 --> 01:48:35,390
A bengali film

1231
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:45,130
Parthavi

1232
01:48:46,810 --> 01:48:47,650
Parthavi!

1233
01:48:49,670 --> 01:48:51,350
Can't you hear I am calling you?

1234
01:48:51,940 --> 01:48:53,090
I have to go to office Madhu

1235
01:48:53,170 --> 01:48:54,400
Office on a Sunday?

1236
01:48:55,120 --> 01:48:56,000
To meet your boss right?

1237
01:48:57,210 --> 01:48:58,580
I am going for work

1238
01:48:58,920 --> 01:49:01,440
You wanted me to take up a job,
so I am doing it

1239
01:49:01,820 --> 01:49:02,500
Then talk to me for a minute, wait

1240
01:49:02,580 --> 01:49:05,590
Leave my hand
I don't want to talk to you

1241
01:49:05,670 --> 01:49:06,370
What?

1242
01:49:07,850 --> 01:49:09,100
Stay away from me

1243
01:49:10,440 --> 01:49:12,570
- Parthavi
- I don't want to listen anything

1244
01:49:12,650 --> 01:49:14,600
I know what do you want to say

1245
01:49:14,830 --> 01:49:17,640
It's all my fault, sorry

1246
01:49:21,590 --> 01:49:23,080
- Parthavi listen to me
- Leave my hand

1247
01:49:23,170 --> 01:49:25,580
- Listen to me
- Madhu it's hurting, leave my hand

1248
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:27,250
Parthavi

1249
01:49:27,330 --> 01:49:28,420
Stay away from me

1250
01:49:28,820 --> 01:49:30,360
- Don't push me Parthavi
- Stay away from me

1251
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:32,540
Stop it, don't push me

1252
01:49:32,620 --> 01:49:34,650
- Parthavi stop it
- Leave my hand

1253
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:36,830
Stop it, don't push me

1254
01:49:36,910 --> 01:49:37,460
leave my hand

1255
01:49:37,540 --> 01:49:38,290
Don't push me Parthavi

1256
01:49:38,370 --> 01:49:39,420
leave my hand

1257
01:49:54,660 --> 01:49:55,620
Parthavi

1258
01:49:57,000 --> 01:49:57,580
Wait

1259
01:49:57,670 --> 01:50:01,410
I made a mistake by coming with you,
huge mistake

1260
01:50:03,220 --> 01:50:05,850
You made a mistake
and I am very happy here?

1261
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:10,990
Because of you we had to elope,
you brought me here

1262
01:50:12,820 --> 01:50:14,480
We eloped to save your life

1263
01:50:14,560 --> 01:50:16,460
You didn't do any
favour by saving my life

1264
01:50:16,690 --> 01:50:18,040
We were in lock-up because of you

1265
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:21,740
Ya it was all because of me, I agree

1266
01:50:27,520 --> 01:50:30,520
Then why did you love me?

1267
01:50:31,370 --> 01:50:33,210
why did you love me?

1268
01:50:33,730 --> 01:50:34,540
Tell me

1269
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:38,650
Why did you love me, why?

1270
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:48,710
Parthavi...

1271
01:50:49,290 --> 01:50:50,330
Parthavi

1272
01:50:50,660 --> 01:50:53,910
Stay away from me Madhu

1273
01:50:54,420 --> 01:50:55,540
Stay away

1274
01:50:59,970 --> 01:51:00,900
Parthavi...

1275
01:51:08,290 --> 01:51:09,120
Parthavi!

1276
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:13,710
- You drive
- Parthavi wait, come out.. come here

1277
01:51:13,790 --> 01:51:14,800
Parthavi...

1278
01:51:34,330 --> 01:51:35,660
Did Parthavi come here?

1279
01:51:36,500 --> 01:51:37,290
Parthavi?

1280
01:51:37,540 --> 01:51:40,290
No. But what happened?
Wasn't she with you?

1281
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:41,420
What happened?

1282
01:51:43,210 --> 01:51:44,460
What happened exaclty?

1283
01:51:46,080 --> 01:51:46,870
Say Madhu

1284
01:51:47,000 --> 01:51:50,330
Hey Madhu

1285
01:51:51,120 --> 01:51:53,120
Hey Madhu

1286
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:54,210
Hey Madhu

1287
01:52:28,750 --> 01:52:30,060
Promila sister...

1288
01:52:30,940 --> 01:52:32,390
I can't find Parthavi anywhere

1289
01:52:33,430 --> 01:52:36,650
We are at the Howrah bridge
but we can't find Parthavi anywhere

1290
01:53:02,140 --> 01:53:05,670
Sir I have just messaged and
e-mailed you the details for Flurrys

1291
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:09,530
Would you like me to send you any
other details of similar restaurants?

1292
01:53:10,650 --> 01:53:12,620
Thanks for calling Justdial sir

1293
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:03,070
One day I will make
a huge mansion for you

1294
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:25,150
I don't want a mansion

1295
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:30,540
I want a home

1296
01:54:34,330 --> 01:54:36,430
our home Madhu

1297
01:54:38,330 --> 01:54:42,880
Where food will be
cooked for only both of us

1298
01:54:44,090 --> 01:54:45,870
not for the world

1299
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:54,130
So you take your big mansion
and throw it in the river

1300
01:54:58,120 --> 01:54:59,750
I want a pappi (kiss)

1301
01:55:02,860 --> 01:55:03,900
Puppy?

1302
01:55:07,130 --> 01:55:09,280
You mean dog's baby?

1303
01:55:31,370 --> 01:55:34,240
Sorry

1304
01:59:15,280 --> 01:59:21,540
The people of Udaipur have made me
victorious once again and hence proved that...

1305
01:59:22,170 --> 01:59:24,520
Udaipur is in safe hands

1306
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:27,290
I don't want to defame the opposition

1307
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:32,900
But Mr Ratan,
you better take care of your house

1308
01:59:34,120 --> 01:59:38,090
your daughter and
your hotel and rule them

1309
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:40,210
That's your real position

1310
01:59:40,570 --> 01:59:44,140
Leave the governance on me

1311
01:59:44,530 --> 01:59:45,810
I will take care of it

1312
01:59:46,340 --> 01:59:49,830
Due to a positive wave of Mrs Sulekha,
Mr Ratan lost heavily

1313
01:59:50,080 --> 01:59:54,450
Mrs Sulekha has created history
by winning with a huge margin

1314
01:59:57,550 --> 02:00:00,430
Mom that old flat I told you about

1315
02:00:02,080 --> 02:00:03,590
we bought it at low price

1316
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:06,170
Ya, we have renovated it a little

1317
02:00:07,600 --> 02:00:09,160
Tomorrow is the
house-warming ceremony

1318
02:00:10,680 --> 02:00:11,600

1319
02:00:12,570 --> 02:00:14,210
No child, I can't come

1320
02:00:14,570 --> 02:00:16,260
But my blessings are with you

1321
02:00:19,620 --> 02:00:24,440
Mom, I am missing dad a lot today

1322
02:00:27,430 --> 02:00:29,470
Is he still angry with me?

1323
02:00:31,590 --> 02:00:33,760
C'mon give the phone to Adi

1324
02:00:35,510 --> 02:00:38,800
Talk to grandma, say hello grandma

1325
02:00:39,040 --> 02:00:39,900
Say Adi

1326

02:00:48,580 --> 02:00:49,530
Talk to her

1329
02:00:51,870 --> 02:00:56,970
Mom, I am giving the priest
an envelope of Rs. 1000 and a vesti.

1330
02:00:57,050 --> 02:00:58,640
It is enough right?

1331
02:01:00,200 --> 02:01:00,990

May you live longer

1339
02:01:48,260 --> 02:01:48,930
Hello

1340
02:01:50,830 --> 02:01:52,170
Ya, I am coming home in 2 minutes

1341
02:01:52,260 --> 02:01:55,710
I know you can speak Bengali,
no need of flaunting it too much

1342
02:01:57,460 --> 02:02:00,000
Come fast Madhu,
the priest will come in an hour

1343
02:02:00,630 --> 02:02:02,050
And don't forget to buy sweets

1344

Yes I'll get it. Ya ok

1345
02:02:03,200 --> 02:02:04,170
Give some more tea to the guest

1346
02:02:05,520 --> 02:02:06,350

Okay bye

1349
02:02:11,170 --> 02:02:12,180
Where is Madhu?

1350
02:02:12,480 --> 02:02:13,830
Still in sports club

1351
02:02:14,630 --> 02:02:17,820
He has also become
useless like Sachin

1352
02:02:17,900 --> 02:02:19,850
I am taking him to the park,
you go home and do the preparations

1353
02:02:19,930 --> 02:02:21,980
Say bye

1354
02:02:22,220 --> 02:02:24,250
Bye bye

1355
02:02:24,800 --> 02:02:25,860
Let's go

1356
02:02:26,480 --> 02:02:28,780
Say bye to mom

Very fine

1361
02:03:04,950 --> 02:03:09,100

1362
02:03:12,180 --> 02:03:13,170
How are you Devi?

1363
02:03:13,250 --> 02:03:13,880
I am good

1364
02:03:14,130 --> 02:03:15,080
Keep it there

1365
02:03:15,600 --> 02:03:17,110
- Keep it here

1366
02:03:17,300 --> 02:03:18,410
Hello

1367
02:03:20,030 --> 02:03:21,280
You have grown a moustache

1368
02:03:21,670 --> 02:03:22,440
Hmm

1369
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:24,570
Please sit

1370
02:03:35,960 --> 02:03:36,810
Nice house

1371
02:03:37,310 --> 02:03:41,000
Ya. It's an old one,
but it's right next to the park

1372
02:03:41,740 --> 02:03:44,690
and there are couple
of schools also nearby, for Adi

1373
02:03:48,140 --> 02:03:49,010
Where is Madhu?

1374
02:03:49,320 --> 02:03:50,520
He should be here anytime

1375
02:03:52,570 --> 02:03:54,170
Please make yourself comfortable

1376
02:05:13,420 --> 02:05:14,650
How are you Madhu?

1377
02:05:16,370 --> 02:05:17,170
Fine

1378
02:05:20,070 --> 02:05:20,920
Parthavi...

1379
02:05:36,670 --> 02:05:37,920
When did they come?

1380
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:38,830
See this

1381
02:05:39,850 --> 02:05:41,780
Dad has sent all this for us

1382
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:46,100
A new shirt for you. See!

1383
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:48,840
- When did they come?
- Just now

1384
02:05:50,590 --> 02:05:51,500
You should have called me at least

1385
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:54,350
I tried, but you didn't receive

1386
02:05:55,420 --> 02:05:58,260
Go serve them tea

1387
02:05:58,340 --> 02:05:59,500
Parthavi, where is Adi?

1388
02:06:00,250 --> 02:06:01,930
He is at the Park with Promila

1389
02:06:04,380 --> 02:06:05,260
You go serve them tea

1390
02:06:07,970 --> 02:06:08,860
What happened?

1391
02:06:10,670 --> 02:06:12,120
I don't want to go

1392
02:06:12,630 --> 02:06:13,420
Why?

1393
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:15,720
They are your brother-in-laws!

1394
02:06:16,870 --> 02:06:18,690
Parthavi you go, I don't want to go

1395
02:06:19,330 --> 02:06:23,050
Hey Madhukar Bagla,
I'll give you a tight slap

1396
02:06:23,780 --> 02:06:24,640
Go fast

1397
02:06:43,300 --> 02:06:45,090
We will go home now

1398
02:06:45,400 --> 02:06:46,660
Then what are we going to do?

1399
02:06:46,940 --> 02:06:48,570
You want a lolly pop?

1400
02:06:48,870 --> 02:06:50,230
We'll get lolly pop

1401
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:52,420
Then what do you want?

1402
02:06:52,820 --> 02:06:55,460
Don't cry don't cry

1403
02:06:55,890 --> 02:06:58,880
Oh god! where is my wallet

1404
02:07:22,050 --> 02:07:24,600
Hey Adi!

1405
02:07:29,090 --> 02:07:30,770
Look who has come Adi

I think he is little scared.
He is your uncle!

1409
02:07:39,170 --> 02:07:40,070
Where is his ball?

1410
02:07:40,150 --> 02:07:42,040
You are so scared of uncle!

1411
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:44,630
I'll get it

1412
02:07:45,070 --> 02:07:46,460
Say hi to uncle

1413

What is this?

1417
02:07:56,420 --> 02:07:57,640
A black thread?

1418
02:07:59,100 --> 02:08:01,170
Look what is that Adi?

1419

Oh! I forgot

1423
02:08:11,510 --> 02:08:13,560
There was only one job to do Madhu!

1424
02:08:19,620 --> 02:08:21,340
Brother I will be back in a while
