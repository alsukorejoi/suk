Good afternoon, Miss Ocean.

00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,079
Hi.

6
00:00:35,081 --> 00:00:37,816
As you know,
parole is a privilege.

7
00:00:37,818 --> 00:00:40,552
And one of the restrictions
on any parolee,

8
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:42,086
is to avoid the company

a criminal record of any kind.

most of your extended family.

not something I'm proud of.

No. See, this is what you do.

I'm interested.

There's a room

that would be maybe

Cartier's director of jewelry

Right.

After she died, they sold it
back to Cartier,

and they've kept it
in their vault ever since.

So then, how are we
gonna get it out?

let it out for her.

01:26:22,423 --> 01:26:23,789
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

1593
01:26:23,791 --> 01:26:25,192
more convicted felon.

1594
01:26:25,194 --> 01:26:27,927
She was present on
the night of the incident.

1595
01:26:27,929 --> 01:26:29,429
Did she steal the necklace?

1596
01:26:29,431 --> 01:26:31,832
Apparently not, she's
the only one with an alibi.

1597
01:26:31,834 --> 01:26:34,333
Smiling at the camera
the entire time.

1598
01:26:34,335 --> 01:26:36,302
Ooh. So...

1599
01:26:36,304 --> 01:26:39,774
So I have five innocent people
who seem to be suspects,

1600
01:26:39,776 --> 01:26:42,278
and someone who should be
a suspect but isn't.

1601
01:26:42,945 --> 01:26:44,744
I have cameras

1602
01:26:44,746 --> 01:26:47,014
covering every inch
of the museum,

1603
01:26:47,016 --> 01:26:49,116
except for the loo,

1604
01:26:49,118 --> 01:26:54,220
where $150 million was stolen
from that neck, your neck.

1605
01:26:54,222 --> 01:26:56,722
- Interesting case.
- Mmm.

1606
01:26:56,724 --> 01:26:58,391
Some days, I love my job.

1607
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:01,295
I love my job, too.

1611
01:27:26,487 --> 01:27:28,223
You guys are fucked.

1612
01:27:29,258 --> 01:27:30,991
Nice place.

1613
01:27:30,993 --> 01:27:32,192
It must be a bitch to heat.

1614
01:27:32,194 --> 01:27:33,993
Excuse me!
You are trespassing.

1615
01:27:33,995 --> 01:27:36,095
No. We asked her to come.

1616
01:27:36,097 --> 01:27:37,766
TAMMY: You asked her to come?

1617
01:27:39,101 --> 01:27:40,332
Oh.

1618
01:27:40,334 --> 01:27:42,269
We realized a few days ago
that Miss Kluger...

1619
01:27:42,271 --> 01:27:44,203
Was not
a total fricking idiot.

1620
01:27:44,205 --> 01:27:47,176
Might have gotten a sense
of what we were doing.

(CLICKS)

1622
01:27:52,181 --> 01:27:54,680
You've got one of the greatest
necks in the world.

1623
01:27:54,682 --> 01:27:56,015
DAPHNE: First of all,
if there's one thing I know,

1624
01:27:56,017 --> 01:27:57,751
it's bad acting.

1625
01:27:57,753 --> 01:27:59,418
In fact,
you've got the only neck

1626
01:27:59,420 --> 01:28:01,190
that could carry
this necklace off.

1627
01:28:02,357 --> 01:28:03,991
DAPHNE:
I almost never throw up.

1628
01:28:03,993 --> 01:28:06,560
Even when I'm really wasted.

1629
01:28:06,562 --> 01:28:08,028
It was in the water.

1630
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:09,870
It must have fallen off
while you were running.

1631
01:28:11,967 --> 01:28:14,701
DAPHNE:
And last but not least,

1632
01:28:14,703 --> 01:28:16,502
I never forget a face.

1633

JOHN: Debbie Ocean.

1634
01:28:20,243 --> 01:28:22,274
Yeah. Yeah.

1635
01:28:22,276 --> 01:28:25,177
So, seems to me,
eight shares of 150 million

1636
01:28:25,179 --> 01:28:28,250
is better than seven shares
of nothing, right?

1637
01:28:29,584 --> 01:28:30,884
Chilly!

1638
01:28:30,886 --> 01:28:32,386
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!

1639
01:28:32,388 --> 01:28:33,921
Let's not all high-five
at once.

1640
01:28:33,923 --> 01:28:36,355
Plus, I am the one
who is saving your asses

1641
01:28:36,357 --> 01:28:38,091
- from insurance fraud.
- What?

1642
01:28:38,093 --> 01:28:40,161
- Insurance fraud?
- I was gonna get to that.

1643
01:28:40,163 --> 01:28:41,595
When?

1644
01:28:41,597 --> 01:28:43,529
It seems that they've assigned
an insurance investigator...

1645
01:28:43,531 --> 01:28:45,832
Who's about to look up
your ass with a flashlight.

1646
01:28:45,834 --> 01:28:47,867
- Who?
- This little Columbo dude,

1647
01:28:47,869 --> 01:28:48,969
everything
but the trench coat.

1648
01:28:48,971 --> 01:28:50,069
Totally on to you.

1649
01:28:50,071 --> 01:28:52,006
His name is John Frazier.

1650
01:28:52,008 --> 01:28:53,373
- You know him?
- Yes.

1651
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,042
He busted my father twice
and my brother once.

1652
01:28:55,044 --> 01:28:56,176
He's family.

1653
01:28:56,178 --> 01:28:57,676
ROSE: All right.
Lest we forget,

1654
01:28:57,678 --> 01:29:00,180
this entire enterprise
was to keep me out of jail.

1655
01:29:00,182 --> 01:29:01,581
Hey. No one's going to jail.

1656
01:29:01,583 --> 01:29:03,582
- CONSTANCE: Are you sure?
- We expected this.

1657
01:29:03,584 --> 01:29:04,818
We prepared for this.

1658
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:06,787
Yup, that's clear.

1659
01:29:06,789 --> 01:29:09,689
We will not be
the prime suspect.

1660
01:29:09,691 --> 01:29:11,591
AMITA: Okay, well then
who will be the prime suspect?

1661
01:29:11,593 --> 01:29:13,894
There's a few.
We've got the security guys,

1662
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:15,194
we've got the busboys...

1663
01:29:15,196 --> 01:29:17,199
The shady guy
who put you away.

1664
01:29:19,433 --> 01:29:21,033
Wow! (CHUCKLES)

1665
01:29:21,035 --> 01:29:23,537
(GASPS) The boyfriend.

1666
01:29:23,539 --> 01:29:26,439
DEBBIE: Yup. They were gonna
be looking for somebody.

1667
01:29:26,441 --> 01:29:29,078
Just had to make sure
it wasn't one of us.

1668
01:29:30,012 --> 01:29:31,478
It's nice.

1669
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,278
Thanks.

1670
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:35,616
That is amazing!
The precision...

1671
01:29:35,618 --> 01:29:36,884
Right?

1672
01:29:36,886 --> 01:29:37,850
It's always
the attention to detail

1673
01:29:37,852 --> 01:29:39,118
and the little grace notes

1674
01:29:39,120 --> 01:29:41,958
that really make
something sing.

1675
01:29:43,092 --> 01:29:44,927
Why are you doing this?

1676
01:29:45,494 --> 01:29:46,529
DAPHNE: Uh...

1677
01:29:48,630 --> 01:29:51,864
I don't have that many close
female friendships.

1678
01:29:51,866 --> 01:29:53,466
And book clubs are the worst.

1679
01:29:53,468 --> 01:29:55,601
So I just thought

1680
01:29:55,603 --> 01:29:57,270
this could be
something fun to share.

1681
01:29:57,272 --> 01:29:59,241
You're becoming a criminal
because you're lonely?

1682
01:30:00,610 --> 01:30:02,975
Who isn't sometimes, right?

1683
01:30:02,977 --> 01:30:04,413
Are you an only child?

1684
01:30:06,248 --> 01:30:08,814
DEBBIE: Midsummer Night's
Dream in Miami?

1685
01:30:08,816 --> 01:30:10,583
TAMMY: It's Shakespeare.

1686
01:30:10,585 --> 01:30:13,653
She did summer stock
at Williamstown,

1687
01:30:13,655 --> 01:30:15,021
plus a bunch of off-Broadway.

1688
01:30:15,023 --> 01:30:16,323
What about this one?
She looks good.

1689
01:30:16,325 --> 01:30:18,323
Let's see. Regional theater,

1690
01:30:18,325 --> 01:30:20,092
but she trained at Juilliard.

1691
01:30:20,094 --> 01:30:21,194
It's really
a magnificent piece.

1692
01:30:21,196 --> 01:30:22,261
This was your mother's?

1693
01:30:22,263 --> 01:30:24,832
Left to me after her passing.

1694
01:30:24,834 --> 01:30:27,368
A Swedish prince
gave it to her

1695
01:30:27,370 --> 01:30:30,603
in exchange
for her deflowering. (GIGGLES)

1696
01:30:30,605 --> 01:30:32,171
Are they worth something?

1697
01:30:32,173 --> 01:30:34,239
Yes, they're worth
quite a lot.

1698
01:30:34,241 --> 01:30:37,610
"Take these,"
my mother said. "Now, go."

1699
01:30:37,612 --> 01:30:38,947
It was moonlight,

1700
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:41,381
and then he said,

1701
01:30:41,383 --> 01:30:44,654
"I'd give you every star
in that sky."

1702
01:30:45,587 --> 01:30:47,753
I'm sorry. (CRYING)

1703
01:30:47,755 --> 01:30:49,557
It must be difficult for you.

1704
01:30:53,395 --> 01:30:55,060
- Claude Becker?
- Yeah.

1705
01:30:55,062 --> 01:30:56,229
- John Frazier.
- Hi.

1706
01:30:56,231 --> 01:30:58,466
SPD Insurance. How are you?

1707
01:30:59,435 --> 01:31:01,370
So, Claude...

1708
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:04,440
Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

1709
01:31:05,007 --> 01:31:06,172
Isn't it?

1710
01:31:06,174 --> 01:31:07,340
What do you want?

1711
01:31:07,342 --> 01:31:10,710
Here are some photographs
of you

1712
01:31:10,712 --> 01:31:12,144
with Miss Kluger.

1713
01:31:12,146 --> 01:31:13,613
Now, as you can see,
there are many photographs

1714
01:31:13,615 --> 01:31:16,283
where your hand
is on the back of her neck.

1715
01:31:16,285 --> 01:31:18,717
I don't really remember
where my hands were.

1716
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:21,087
Ah. To be you.

1717
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:22,290
Right?

1718
01:31:23,726 --> 01:31:25,091
Problem is,

1719
01:31:25,093 --> 01:31:26,426
the necklace has been stolen

1720
01:31:26,428 --> 01:31:28,295
and a fake has been put
in its place.

1721
01:31:28,297 --> 01:31:29,429
Right now, you're the person

1722
01:31:29,431 --> 01:31:30,698
with the greatest
opportunity...

1723
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,933
Why would I wanna steal
a necklace?

1724
01:31:32,935 --> 01:31:34,971
That's what
I keep asking myself.

1725
01:31:35,904 --> 01:31:37,505
Why would this guy,

1726
01:31:39,740 --> 01:31:41,343
who's got everything,

1727
01:31:42,611 --> 01:31:44,013
two of these...

1728
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:48,150
Why would that guy wanna
steal a necklace?

1729
01:31:50,051 --> 01:31:51,587
What was your answer?

1730
01:31:53,187 --> 01:31:55,123
Maybe he doesn't have
everything.

1731
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:57,091
I think we're done here.

1732
01:31:57,093 --> 01:31:58,457
- Just a theory.
- Really.

1733
01:31:58,459 --> 01:31:59,792
- A shot in the dark.
- We're done.

1734
01:31:59,794 --> 01:32:01,226
I'm probably wrong.

1735
01:32:01,228 --> 01:32:04,163
It's a beautiful piece,
and I want you to have it.

1736
01:32:04,165 --> 01:32:06,569
I can't go any lower.
Just hold on one second.

1737
01:32:08,870 --> 01:32:10,071
Hello?

1738
01:32:11,072 --> 01:32:12,372
Oh, hey.

1739
01:32:12,374 --> 01:32:13,873
Hi.

1740
01:32:13,875 --> 01:32:15,341
What're you doing right now?

1741
01:32:15,343 --> 01:32:17,545
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

1742
01:32:22,851 --> 01:32:24,083
DEBBIE: Hello, John.

1743
01:32:24,085 --> 01:32:25,385
Hello, Debbie.

1744
01:32:25,387 --> 01:32:27,220
You look well,
how long's it been?

1745
01:32:27,222 --> 01:32:30,222
A few years.
Minus good behavior.

1746
01:32:30,224 --> 01:32:31,791
- Right.
- Yeah.

1747
01:32:31,793 --> 01:32:34,094
Thank you for calling.
I was gonna call you.

1748
01:32:34,096 --> 01:32:36,130
- Yeah, I didn't do it.
- Of course not.

1749
01:32:36,132 --> 01:32:37,663
You were just on camera
20 feet away

1750
01:32:37,665 --> 01:32:38,998
while the jewels
