00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:05,706
A powerful
new strain of influenza

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:08,442
has killed more
than 5,000 people in Egypt,

3
00:00:08,609 --> 00:00:10,511
according to reports out
of Cairo.

4
00:00:13,881 --> 00:00:15,316
New cases of Saharan flu

5
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:19,187
were reported in France,
Spain, Germany, and Italy.

6
00:00:22,356 --> 00:00:23,457
The flu is spreading

7
00:00:23,624 --> 00:00:25,526
beyond doctors' abilities
to contain it.

8
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:31,899
The flu
has reached U.S. shores,

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,067
with cases reported in...

10
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,335
We have reports
that a million

11
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,636
have died in the Middle East.

12
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:37,638
...and San Francisco.

13
00:00:43,211 --> 00:00:45,579
We have reports
that a million have died...

14
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,290
The World Health Organization

15
00:00:56,524 --> 00:00:58,726
warns that this could be
a civilization-ending event.

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,428
...this could be
a civilization-ending event.

17
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,235
Riots are breaking out
across the country,

18
00:01:07,368 --> 00:01:09,403
as people desperately try
to secure

19
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,272
life-support bunkers
for their families.

20
00:01:11,405 --> 00:01:13,407
To ensure survival
of the human race.

21
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,912
The World Health Organization
has started construction

22
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:21,249
on half a million
underground bunkers.

23
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,789
Scientists are searching
desperately for a cure,

24
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,125
but they warn
that Saharan flu mortality

25
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,461
could be 100 percent.

26
00:01:38,098 --> 00:01:39,733
Authorities promise
lottery winners

27
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:42,770
will have access to bunkers
within 24 hours.

28
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:44,071
...survive.

29
00:01:47,408 --> 00:01:50,278
With an estimated
three billion dead worldwide,

30
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:53,347
it is unclear if the bunkers
will be finished in time.

31
00:01:57,385 --> 00:01:59,119
Authorities promise
lottery winners

32
00:01:59,253 --> 00:02:02,456
will have access to bunkers
within 24 hours.

33
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:08,429
This is our final broadcast.

34
00:02:09,397 --> 00:02:11,665
Good luck, and Godspeed.

35
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,651
I'm thoroughly disgusted.

36
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,686
I-- I don't even know
if I can look at you the sa--

37
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,588
Cool it! You're gonna
give yourself a stroke.

38
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:36,089
And at your age, Atlanta,
you need

39
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:37,791
- to take care of yourself.
- You seem very calm

40
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,793
for someone who just confessed
to murder.

41
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:42,296
I mean, I get bored.
I do-- I do some bad shit.

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,464
Ain't never hurt none of y'all.

43
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,965
You've hurt us now.
Now we can't pretend

44
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:46,767
- you're not such a bad guy.
- Come on.

45
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,869
- You knew I was a bad guy.
- Right.

46
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:49,903
But now we can't pretend--

47
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,239
You know,
I'm-- I'm almost flattered

48
00:02:51,372 --> 00:02:52,706
by that, Denver, but, honestly,

49
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,342
I could care less
what you think.

50
00:02:54,475 --> 00:02:55,743
You couldn't care less.

51
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:57,478
- What?
- The phrase,

52
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,280
it's you couldn't care less.

53
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,049
Saying you could care less means
that you actually care.

54
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,684
Well, how
about I don't give a rat's ass?

55
00:03:03,817 --> 00:03:05,219
- You like that, Denver?
- That's actually better.

56
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,720
- Congratulations.
- You starting shit

57
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,188
just for kicks, Orlando?

58
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,291
That's classy, man.
Keeping it mature.

59
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:11,825
What, you think I'm here
to entertain y'all?

60
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:13,494
Nah. Just think
you're one fucked-up dude.

61
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:15,229
You sure you're not talking
about yourself there, hombre?

62
00:03:15,363 --> 00:03:17,365
Hey, only God can judge us, man.

63
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:20,200
You know, I've been staring
at your boring, mopey faces

64
00:03:20,334 --> 00:03:23,337
on this little digital box
for half a decade.

65
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,706
I mean, it's time for a change,
right?

66
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,008
Some truth, some honesty.

67
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,177
You don't give a shit
about honesty.

68
00:03:30,544 --> 00:03:31,945
You just like the sound
of your own voice.

69
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:33,414
That hurts me, Chicago.

70
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:35,082
I value honesty.

71
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:37,985
It's what separates the men
from children.

72
00:03:38,118 --> 00:03:39,520
Hmm, real men don't lie.
Is that it?

73
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:40,821
Yeah,
that's what little, uh,

74
00:03:41,188 --> 00:03:43,156
pissy babies like you say,
right?

75
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,326
That's why you're a child...

76
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,027
and I'm a man.

77
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,529
You never did fit in with us.

78
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,099
- This explains so much.
- Ah, that really means a lot

79
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,767
coming from you there, Atlanta.

80
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,436
I mean, there's no way
in hell you could survive

81
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,905
- out there in the real world.
- We are all survivors.

82
00:03:58,038 --> 00:03:59,707
I'm talking about living
in the shit.

83
00:03:59,873 --> 00:04:01,241
Atlanta here,
she ain't never lived

84
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,410
- in no shit!
- It's no excuse

85
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,812
- for what you've done.
- But least I own it!

86
00:04:04,945 --> 00:04:06,414
How many people
have you killed, anyway?

87
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:08,516
Ah, to be honest, 15.

88
00:04:08,649 --> 00:04:10,217
I don't know. Maybe 20,
if you want to be real.

89
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,086
- Oh, my God.
- "Oh, my God." Are you serious?

90
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,889
Come on. Most of them
were bank robberies gone bad.

91
00:04:16,424 --> 00:04:17,725
Okay, I'm sorry. Hold on.

92
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,028
There was a time that I did it
for sport,

93
00:04:21,228 --> 00:04:23,764
and to tell you the truth,
it was actually fun.

94
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:27,901
I am trying to find a way
to pray for your soul...

95
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,270
but I'm not even sure
if you have one.

96
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:32,806
Oh, and this is coming
from the mother of the year.

97
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,075
What's it like to, uh,

98
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:36,810
think about those three
precious angels

99
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,547
up there,
dead with everyone else?

100
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,249
- How dare you?
- No, I mean, I'm just asking.

101
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:43,617
I mean, they were--
They were kids, right?

102
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,487
I mean, that is a hell of a way
to go, especially being so young.

103
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:47,721
Dude!

104
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,222
Too far, man. That's fucked up.

105
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,825
But that's what I'm talking
about. It's the truth!

106
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,095
Hey, the truth!
And none of you want to hear it!

107
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,264
You know what? You're right.

108
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:01,669
I don't want to hear it.

109
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:03,837
I have a proposal
for the Domain.

110
00:05:03,971 --> 00:05:06,474
Oh, here it comes,
the bullshit democracy.

111
00:05:06,607 --> 00:05:08,376
Since day one,
Orlando's been nothing

112
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:10,944
but a thorn in our sides
and now he's confessing

113
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:12,513
to brutally murdering
innocent people.

114
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:13,847
No, no, no.
They weren't all innocent.

115
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,282
We don't have
to listen to it anymore.

116
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,918
We can just ban him
and shut off his feed for good.

117
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,021
Ah! I love it! You can't ban me.

118
00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:23,591
- I can.
- For real?

119
00:05:24,091 --> 00:05:25,659
You can just shut us off
at any time?

120
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,495
It's not that simple, okay?

121
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:28,862
It's-- It's a hack I came across

122
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:30,464
after studying the code
for years,

123
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:32,966
but that doesn't mean
I agree with Boston.

124
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,868
Banning someone is permanent.

125
00:05:35,369 --> 00:05:37,505
We can't come back from it,
so we have to make sure

126
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:39,306
that this is something
we all wanna do.

127
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,274
So that's why we vote.
It's what we do.

128
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,444
Oh, this-- This here,
is a frigging joke.

129
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:46,113
I have to listen
to this blah-blah-blah bullshit,

130
00:05:46,246 --> 00:05:47,114
day in and day out.

131
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,682
Banning me is not a punishment.

132
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,651
Orlando, banning you
is permanent.

133
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,286
No contact with anybody

134
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,622
for the rest
of your time down here.

135
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,189
That could mean
more than 20 years.

136
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:59,226
Well, that to me, sounds
like a 20-year vacation.

137
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:03,063
Who votes to ban Orlando
from the Domain?

138
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,164
I do.

139
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:07,367
- Me.
- We need one more. Phoenix?

140
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,639
- This feels wrong.
- Be reasonable.

141
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,240
- It's extreme.
- He's extreme.

142
00:06:15,342 --> 00:06:18,011
- No, I can't do it.
- Come on.

143
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,681
He could be alone for decades.
It's not fair.

144
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,382
Maybe he deserves it.

145
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,386
I'm sorry. I can't sign off
on this. No. I vote no.

146
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,523
Denver, I'm assuming
you're voting with Phoenix.

147
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:31,525
Yes, I am.

148
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:33,561
That's two against three.

149
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,097
Houston... you're it.
What's it gonna be?

150
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,266
Ah, fuck, man, I don't--
I don't wanna be the last vote.

151
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,734
- You gotta do it.
- Shit.

152
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:44,071
I can't, man. I ca--
I can't vote.

153
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:46,373
You know, let me make this easy
for all of you.

154
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,375
Do it.

155
00:06:49,142 --> 00:06:51,979
- Ban me.
- Wow. I wasn't expecting that.

156
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,346
Shut him down.

157
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,348
No, I won't do it
until Phoenix says it's okay.

158
00:06:55,483 --> 00:06:57,951
It's not up to her. We voted.
It's over.

159
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,587
He's right, Denver.
It's not up to me.

160
00:07:00,287 --> 00:07:02,590
Unplug it, Denver.

161
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,794
Did I ever tell you guys
I'm a psychic?

162
00:07:07,761 --> 00:07:09,963
I could read minds
and the future.

163
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,765
You want me to tell you
what the future holds

164
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:14,968
- for all of you?
- Denver, unplug him now.

165
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,039
Pain and suffering,

166
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:21,208
a life of shit
like you could never imagine,

167
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,643
nothing but pure misery.

168
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,879
And you know what really--
It pisses me off,

169
00:07:26,213 --> 00:07:28,415
because I'm not gonna be here
to witness it.

170
00:07:33,721 --> 00:07:34,588
Done.

171
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:36,590
Amen.

172
00:08:10,758 --> 00:08:11,859
You awake?

173
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:18,866
Yeah.

174
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:33,581
How you feeling?

175
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,450
Pretty restless.

176
00:08:38,552 --> 00:08:41,689
Yeah. Today was, uh,
was rough.

177
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:43,557
Mm-hmm.

178
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,095
Did you agree with me?

179
00:08:50,130 --> 00:08:51,031
Yeah, of course.

180
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:55,002
I wouldn't have done it
unless you said it was okay.

181
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:56,904
I know.

182
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,442
But did you actually agree
with my point?

183
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,578
Yeah. I mean, I was...

184
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,815
I was torn. You know, I can see

185
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,316
where the others
are coming from.

186
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,018
People make mistakes.

187
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,386
We've all made mistakes.

188
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,188
So no one
should ever be punished?

189
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,725
I'm not saying that, no.

190
00:09:19,627 --> 00:09:21,361
I guess
I just don't feel comfortable...

191
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:22,863
judging.

192
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,666
You gotta remember, Phoenix,
he's not dead.

193
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,403
Okay? He's still in a bunker
in Florida in some marsh,

194
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,441
spouting his redneck bullshit
philosophies to himself,

195
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:36,543
so don't lose
too much sleep over it.

196
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:39,780
And who knows? This could
be over in a year, right?

197
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:41,581
Wouldn't even matter.

198
00:09:42,282 --> 00:09:43,751
That would be so nice.

199
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,120
Do you ever think about just

200
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,722
what it would be like to...

201
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,291
be in the same room together...

202
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:54,061
all the time?

203
00:09:55,295 --> 00:09:57,631
No more... screens...

204
00:09:58,531 --> 00:09:59,767
be able to touch you?

205
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,238
- Never.
- Mm.

206
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:08,108
Of course I do.

207
00:10:10,377 --> 00:10:12,379
It's what keeps me
looking forward to the future.

208
00:10:18,018 --> 00:10:19,086
I love you, Phoenix.

209
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,723
I love you, too.

210
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,034
Please dispense Supplival.

211
00:12:20,707 --> 00:12:22,742
Please dispense Supplival.

212
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,221
Supplival dispensed.

213
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,491
- Morning.
- Hey.

214
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,595
- Did you sleep okay?
- Not really.

215
00:13:18,231 --> 00:13:19,666
Was it another dream
about your mom?

216
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:23,503
What about your mom?

217
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:25,605
Well, thank you
for interrupting, Boston.

218
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,639
Morning to you, too, Denver.

219
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,341
You know, do you ever consider--
I don't know,

220
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,111
maybe not barging in
on a private conversation?

221
00:13:31,244 --> 00:13:32,779
Hey, if you two have
a secret to share,

222
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:34,314
you can always start
your own chat room.

223
00:13:34,614 --> 00:13:36,249
Common feed is fair game.

224
00:13:40,387 --> 00:13:42,789
Oh, wow.

225
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:45,225
This migraine.

226
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:47,394
Eighty percent
of migraines result

227
00:13:47,527 --> 00:13:50,563
- from dehydration.
- That statistic reeks of B.S.

228
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:51,865
- Can you prove me wrong?
- Yeah,

229
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,066
but I don't have time.

230
00:13:55,768 --> 00:13:57,137
Good morning, angels.

231
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:00,307
Mommy has a headache.

232
00:14:00,773 --> 00:14:01,975
Fuck, man!

233
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:05,078
Fuck! This sleep cycle's
fucking bullshit!

234
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,751
Look what the cat dragged in.

235
00:14:11,952 --> 00:14:14,354
Get off my back, Boston.
Slept like shit.

236
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,323
If I didn't know any better,
I'd say you looked hung over.

237
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,724
Man, I wish.

238
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,859
Uh, wow,
like a couple of bottles

239
00:14:19,993 --> 00:14:21,494
and some bitches, shit.

240
00:14:21,628 --> 00:14:23,897
We could have ourselves
a party, right, Atlanta?

241
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:26,199
You know what, Houston?
I'm not even gonna dignify that

242
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,969
- with a response.
- Aw, you love me.

243
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,139
Oh, fuck!

244
00:14:32,672 --> 00:14:35,042
God, I hope this fucking shit
doesn't keep up.

245
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,576
You can't sleep,
put a blanket over your head.

246
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,311
Fuck, I'll put a blanket
over your mom's head.

247
00:14:38,445 --> 00:14:39,412
The sleep cycle

248
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:40,847
doesn't just affect
the lighting, okay?

249
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,349
It--
It affects your inner clock.

250
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:45,552
- Yeah, what Denver said.
- Oh, yeah, I forgot.

251
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,621
Denver is the resident expert
on everything.

252
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:51,358
- Well, you said it, not me.
- Chicago.

253
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,427
- Nice of you to join us.
- Give me a break.

254
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,563
Think I have a cold.

255
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,399
You're in a hermetically
sealed environment, so...

256
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,601
that's actually,
physically impossible.

257
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,270
Well,
something's making me sick.

258
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,904
Maybe you should drink
a fucking Supplival,

259
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,406
get some meat
on your weak-ass bones.

260
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,907
- Back off.
- All this doom and gloom.

261
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,577
Everybody cheer up.
We're alive another day.

262
00:15:11,211 --> 00:15:12,912
- Happy now?
- Oui, monsieur.

263
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,548
Phoenix, you still working
on your French?

264
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:17,884
Oui. C'est bien. Et tu?

265
00:15:18,151 --> 00:15:21,955
Uh, les chatons son...

266
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,157
mignons?

267
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:26,226
Did you just say that kittens
are cute?

268
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:28,595
That's, um,
not what I meant to say.

269
00:15:28,728 --> 00:15:30,297
- Well, what did you mean to say?
- Doesn't really matter.

270
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,931
- I'm still learning.
- You know, you've been learning

271
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,900
for two years now

272
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,069
- with no visible progress.
- Denver.

273
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:37,404
I don't study every day.

274
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,306
- This is just for fun.
- I'm sure that's why you do it.

275
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,307
What's that supposed to mean?

276
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,809
While you two are busy bickering
like an old married couple,

277
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:44,644
I'm gonna go ahead
and do my morning prayers.

278
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,579
Anybody care to join?

279
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,648
Every morning
you ask us if we wanna pray

280
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,483
and the answer is always
the same.

281
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,319
Isn't that the definition
of psychosis?

282
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,586
I'll pray with you.

283
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:55,155
- Really?
- Sure.

284
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,190
I don't know any prayers,
though.

285
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,192
That's okay.
Uh, I can send you one.

286
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,499
It's one that, uh,
I used to do with my girls

287
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,001
just before I put them to bed.

288
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:09,769
Got it?

289
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:11,871
- Yep.
- Okay.

290
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:15,775
- O Lord, make me brave.
- Make me brave.

291
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,279
Brave enough to face the dark,

292
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:22,515
the dark that works
to pull me in.

293
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,818
As the storm rages through...

294
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:30,390
let me rise above the gale
with bright eyes,

295
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,693
confident Thy way is wise.

296
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:36,763
Lord, make me brave...

297
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,700
brave to face the murk of life.

298
00:16:41,934 --> 00:16:43,870
Help me with my human plight.

299
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:47,274
Help me to retain my sight...

300
00:16:48,441 --> 00:16:50,843
to know that from the dark
comes light.

301
00:16:52,312 --> 00:16:55,315
To know that
from the dark comes light.

302
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,685
- Amen.
- Amen.

303
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,689
Thanks, Phoenix. That was nice.

304
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,358
Very nice. Touching, even.

305
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,060
All right, everybody,
let's get ready for the day.

306
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:08,361
Morning reports, let's hear 'em.

307
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,897
Okay, the Network neutralized

308
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,766
almost three billion
Saharan flu particles overnight.

309
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,404
That's a .009 increase
from yesterday.

310
00:17:18,071 --> 00:17:20,607
A slight uptick.
That's the good news.

311
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,377
Bad news is that works out
to about 19 years

312
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,414
- before total containment.
- Oh, God damn!

313
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,416
I hope that shit picks up
the pace, man.

314
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,650
Well, there was that one night

315
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:31,918
where it jumped up
a whole percentage point.

316
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,353
Atlanta's on the right track.

317
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,155
We have to stay optimistic

318
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:36,889
because we do not know
what's gonna happen tomorrow.

319
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,891
Probably nothing,
just like yesterday

320
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,993
and the day before that,
day before that,

321
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,429
Atlanta, you're up.

322
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,764
Okay,
so blood scans look normal.

323
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,434
Except, Phoenix,
your pressure's up.

324
00:17:47,834 --> 00:17:49,736
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

325
00:17:49,969 --> 00:17:50,970
Maybe I'm not reading it right,

326
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,572
but your brain scan
looks kinda weird.

327
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:54,207
Maybe someone else should, uh,

328
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,875
- read the brain scan.
- Hey, man, fuck you.

329
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,444
- I can read this.
- Just had a bad dream,

330
00:17:57,577 --> 00:17:59,712
and I'm feeling kind of out
of it. It's probably just that.

331
00:18:00,046 --> 00:18:01,248
Was the bad dream
about your mom?

332
00:18:01,848 --> 00:18:03,250
I'd rather not talk
about it right now.

333
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,952
- Jesus, Boston.
- I'm sorry.

334
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:09,956
- Wow, that was-- That was rude.
- Anyway, moving on.

335
00:18:11,258 --> 00:18:15,662
Bunker population is 489,573,

336
00:18:15,795 --> 00:18:18,931
which is down eight
from yesterday.

337
00:18:19,065 --> 00:18:20,099
That's not good.

338
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:22,735
- It's probably just a bad night.
- This is so stupid.

339
00:18:23,136 --> 00:18:24,471
We're all looking
at the same numbers

340
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:26,306
on this tiny, little screen.

341
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,107
Why are we pretending
like we have separate jobs?

342
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,109
Because we have to keep focused.

343
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,545
Each one of us has one statistic
to keep an eye on.

344
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:33,946
- I don't.
- Yeah, because you didn't wanna

345
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,715
- participate, remember?
- Because it's a waste of time.

346
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,250
No, it is not!

347
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,957
- Ah, shit, no, man.
- You did that on purpose.

348
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,759
Do you
like wasting your life? Here.

349
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:49,396
Watch an instructional video
you've seen a thousand times.

350
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:51,898
You need
a serious attitude adjustment.

351
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:54,434
I'm out. I'll see you in, like,
five minutes.

352
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,305
Why can't you get
this stupid thing to stop?

353
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,939
I thought you'd really,
really like it.

354
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,978
Hello. My name is Nadine,
and I am the designer

355
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:09,182
of the LSB-300
life-support bunker.

356
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:10,550
If you're watching this,

357
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,786
the lottery is over
and you are one of the lucky few

358
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,189
who will live through
the Saharan flu epidemic.

359
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,325
You are a survivor.

360
00:19:20,126 --> 00:19:21,027
If need be,

361
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,231
your bunker can keep you alive
for up to 70 years.

362
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,898
Yeah, I tell you,
I ain't gonna last 70 hours

363
00:19:26,032 --> 00:19:27,099
if this shit don't stop.

364
00:19:27,434 --> 00:19:29,035
It'll work itself out.
Just calm down.

365
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,303
Oh, you want to trade bunkers?

366
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,639
To protect you
from surface conditions,

367
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:35,608
your bunker
is 30 feet underground.

368
00:19:35,775 --> 00:19:37,277
The artificial day cycle

369
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:39,646
will keep
your sleep patterns normal.

370
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:41,147
Your bunker is stocked

371
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:44,284
with enough Supplival powder
to last a lifetime.

372
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,521
When mixed with water,
Supplival creates

373
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:51,458
a delicious shake
that's packed with nutrients

374
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:54,026
in vanilla, strawberry
or chocolate.

375
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,028
This is so not
a chocolate shake.

376
00:19:56,463 --> 00:19:57,464
The generator powers

377
00:19:57,897 --> 00:19:59,932
the bunker's closed-loop air
and water filtration.

378
00:20:00,066 --> 00:20:02,502
One hundred percent
of what you consume is recycled.

379
00:20:02,635 --> 00:20:04,371
Wait a minute. Does that mean
we drink our own piss?

380
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,038
You just now realized that?

381
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,307
Science is amazing.

382
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,208
The Generator
also powers

383
00:20:09,342 --> 00:20:10,777
the atmosphere purifier.

384
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,546
The purifier filters
contaminated air molecules

385
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,214
and strips them off the virus.

386
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:18,217
The 500,000 bunkers
that make up the network,

387
00:20:18,351 --> 00:20:21,754
operate in tandem
to eliminate the viral threat.

388
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:23,690
The network generates
an estimate

389
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:27,026
for how long this process
will take based on daily data,

390
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,529
which you can view
on your statistics terminal.

391
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:31,998
Solitary habitation is necessary

392
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:34,734
to ensure that the virus
spreads no further.

393
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,770
To combat the inevitable sense
of isolation,

394
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:40,840
we created Domain.

395
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,276
Domain is an information

396
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,878
and social networking platform.

397
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:51,217
Domain also allows full access
to our encyclopedia archives.

398
00:20:51,818 --> 00:20:53,953
Studies found that groups
of seven

399
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:57,924
create an ideal long-term
social-networking community.

400
00:20:58,325 --> 00:21:00,159
Each group of seven was selected

401
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:04,130
using algorithms derived
from your personal histories.

402
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:07,567
Right now, I, too,
am probably living out my days

403
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:10,570
in an LSB-300 just like yours,

404
00:21:11,237 --> 00:21:13,340
wondering how much longer
I'll be down here.

405
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,342
One thing is certain:

406
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,110
we will eradicate
the Saharan flu.

407
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:21,448
Your efforts matter. You matter.

408
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,783
We are the survivors.

409
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:26,653
An Earth free
of this virus awaits.

410
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:29,956
Humanity is counting on us.

411
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:50,977
What is it?

412
00:21:53,212 --> 00:21:54,246
I was just thinking,

413
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,182
when we finally get out
of here...

414
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,352
are we gonna call each other
by our real names?

415
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:03,022
Dean Atkins.

416
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:06,959
It sounds so strange
coming out of your mouth.

417
00:22:10,096 --> 00:22:11,163
Say mine.

418
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:13,700
Kimberly Miller.

419
00:22:16,703 --> 00:22:18,371
That sounds so weird.

420
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,674
Let's just stick
with our handles.

421
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,878
Warning. Warning.

422
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:28,848
Warning. Power backup
below 50 percent.

423
00:22:28,981 --> 00:22:30,717
Charge generator immediately.

424
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,218
Atlanta,
you gotta make this a routine.

425
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,554
- You can't skip any more days.
- I know. I know.

426
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:37,356
Its's not like I have to watch
my figure for anybody down here.

427
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:40,126
Warning.
Power backup below 50 percent.

428
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:42,361
Charge generator immediately.

429
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,706
- Do you guys see this?
- What is it?

430
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:55,875
My terminal's freaking out.

431
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,812
Oh, that is weird. Mine, too.

432
00:23:02,515 --> 00:23:04,784
Well, now it's--
Now it's totally dead.

433
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:08,087
- What the fuck?
- This a glitch?

434
00:23:09,255 --> 00:23:10,457
Maybe it's just rebooting.

435
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,224
No, mine's--
Mine's completely off.

436
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:13,560
This is not good.

437
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,795
These are supposed to be
on all the time.

438
00:23:15,928 --> 00:23:17,730
That's-- That's the whole point,
live data.

439
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,466
Fuck is going on?

440
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:21,901
I mean, first my sleep cycle?
Now this bullshit?

441
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:23,903
This is affecting all of us.
You know, your sleep cycle,

442
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,204
that's probably just
a malfunction.

443
00:23:25,337 --> 00:23:26,973
How the hell do you know that?
How do you know

444
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:28,475
someone's not just fucking
with me on purpose?

445
00:23:28,608 --> 00:23:29,942
- Who would do that?
- How about Orlando?

446
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,143
He fucking hates us for sure.

447
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,913
That's it, guys. The end of days
are upon us.

448
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:35,715
Could really do
without your sarcasm right now.

449
00:23:35,848 --> 00:23:37,850
- I'm not being sarcastic.
- You know, I don't know, guys.

450
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,085
This is making me kind of worry.

451
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,220
Relax. It'll probably
come back on in a minute.

452
00:23:41,353 --> 00:23:42,955
Probably? What do you mean,
"Probably"?

453
00:23:43,189 --> 00:23:44,557
We have no idea
if it'll come back on.

454
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:46,225
- I'm an optimistic guy.
- We are spread out

455
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:47,894
over the entire country.

456
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:50,863
You understand there's no--
There's no actual physical wires

457
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:52,231
connecting our bunkers.

458
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,366
This has to be
a systemic shutdown.

459
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:55,535
It's pure speculation.

460
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:58,037
You know,
for a self-appointed leader,

461
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,240
you are depressingly short
on actual ideas.

462
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,709
Okay, well,
what brilliant suggestions

463
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,276
- do you have then, Denver?
- I'm not saying

464
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:06,579
I have one. I just don't think
sticking your head in the sand

465
00:24:06,713 --> 00:24:07,780
should be an option.

466
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,584
I think we should turn
Orlando's feedback on.

467
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,919
- What? No-- No!
- Why?

468
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:15,154
Maybe we broke the system
when we banned him.

469
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,624
Think about it.
There are supposed

470
00:24:17,924 --> 00:24:20,760
to be seven of us and right now,
there are only six.

471
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,530
- Maybe we caused the glitch.
- That is pretty thin.

472
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:26,265
We banned him.
We don't want him here!

473
00:24:26,398 --> 00:24:28,535
Listen, Atlanta, I know.
I don't like him either...

474
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:31,203
but without the terminal,

475
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:33,506
we're blind to everything
that's going on outside.

476
00:24:34,406 --> 00:24:36,108
Bringing Orlando back
might fix the problem.

477
00:24:36,242 --> 00:24:39,111
- No, we voted on this.
- Yeah, like, eight months ago.

478
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:41,781
The ban, it was--
It was permanent.

479
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:44,517
Denver...
you out of all people

480
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:46,118
have gotta be able to figure
that out.

481
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:49,288
No, I-- I really don't think
that's possible.

482
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,590
Really?

483
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52,491
Seriously,
you're not even gonna try.

484
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:53,526
Yeah, okay...

485
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,362
I'll try but I'm telling you,
everything I know

486
00:24:56,596 --> 00:24:58,097
says that this isn't gonna work.

487
00:24:58,798 --> 00:25:00,166
Well, there you go.
It's a nonissue.

488
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,201
Fine.

489
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:07,607
Phoenix, what are you doing?

490
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,480
Stop. You--
You already did that today.

491
00:25:15,648 --> 00:25:16,583
Phoenix.

492
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:21,588
Listen, it doesn't store
extra energy or...

493
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,160
Phoenix.

494
00:25:29,662 --> 00:25:32,431
- Phoenix, why are you mad?
- Because you won't even try.

495
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:36,402
- I sa-- I will try.
- But it won't work.

496
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:37,870
And so if you don't think
it's gonna work,

497
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,338
then you're not gonna
make it work.

498
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,909
Will you s...

499
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,312
Phoenix, will you stop, please?

500
00:25:46,979 --> 00:25:49,716
Please, just sit down
and talk to me.

501
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,471
I want to help, okay?

502
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:15,207
Do you?

503
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,811
Yes. Why would you say that?
Of course I do.

504
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,580
Then let me do this
at my own pace.

505
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,251
Okay. I'm not...

506
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,721
trying to force anything.
I-- I just wanna help.

507
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:36,095
I don't know
where to start.

508
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:42,301
This is about your mom, right?

509
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,741
My mom isn't alive.

510
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:51,711
Yeah, I know.

511
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:55,147
I mean, she wasn't alive
before all this.

512
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,389
I...

513
00:27:05,858 --> 00:27:07,593
I was in prison
when I won the lottery.

514
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,230
Really?

515
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:15,267
What happened?

516
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,638
I never knew my dad,
'cause he died when I was young.

517
00:27:22,675 --> 00:27:24,010
My mom raised me alone.

518
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,714
She worked constantly,
'cause she had to.

519
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,484
I spent a lot
of my teenage years alone...

520
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,321
got in with a bad crowd...

521
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:39,358
got into drugs, mostly meth.

522
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:43,730
I lied, stole...

523
00:27:45,832 --> 00:27:47,633
ran away from home
when I was 17...

524
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,970
came back when I OD'ed.

525
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,540
Didn't stop.

526
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,445
Uh, one night...

527
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,281
I got high...

528
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:04,283
paranoid...

529
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,453
accused my mom
of stealing my stash.

530
00:28:18,998 --> 00:28:19,999
Um...

531
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:25,604
I went down to the kitchen...

532
00:28:27,639 --> 00:28:29,075
grabbed a paring knife...

533
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:33,345
went back up the stairs
and I-- I stabbed her.

534
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:47,994
Uh, the drugs were
in my room where I left 'em.

535
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:55,868
I'm so sorry, Phoenix.

536
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:59,538
I wish I could hold you
right now.

537
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,545
When did this happen?

538
00:29:09,816 --> 00:29:11,283
I was in prison a year
when the flu hit,

539
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,085
so almost seven years ago now.

540
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:20,259
The whole Orlando thing
makes a lot of sense now.

541
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:23,062
Banning him was wrong.

542
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,566
Who am I to judge?

543
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:30,937
Phoenix, it's not the same.

544
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,640
Yeah, you're right.
What I did was worse.

545
00:29:34,907 --> 00:29:36,075
- Phoenix--
- I'm not looking

546
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,243
for your sympathy.

547
00:29:39,545 --> 00:29:41,780
Lifting the ban on Orlando
is the right thing to do.

548
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,517
Okay.

549
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,020
Okay, you're right.

550
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:51,457
I will do everything I can
to lift the ban.

551
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:03,903
I'm lucky to have you here
with me.

552
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,273
I'm the lucky one.

553
00:31:30,756 --> 00:31:32,591
- Phoenix!
- Mm.

554
00:31:35,161 --> 00:31:36,628
- Mm, what's going on?
- Phoenix, hey.

555
00:31:36,762 --> 00:31:38,965
I-- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.

556
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,967
- Um...
- What time is it?

557
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,401
It's-- It's early-- Late.

558
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:43,835
It's late, maybe. I don't know.

559
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,537
I don't know. I've been working
on lifting this ban thing,

560
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:46,973
but I think I--
I figured it out.

561
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,614
- Did you have any luck?
- I'm not 100 percent sure

562
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:56,949
that this is gonna work, but...

563
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,252
there is a possibility
that I-- I could ban myself

564
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:02,554
- or one of you guys.
- Okay, well, don't do that.

565
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,590
I know. I--
I don't want to do that,

566
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:06,558
but are you sure
that we shouldn't tell

567
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:07,626
the others about this?

568
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:09,528
Why? So Boston
can tell us not to do it?

569
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:11,030
- I mean, what's the point?
- Yeah.

570
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,365
Okay. You're right.
You're right. Um...

571
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,703
Here we go.

572
00:32:26,045 --> 00:32:27,313
Orlando.

573
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,418
Orlando, are you there?

574
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,122
Orlando, it's--
It's Phoenix and Denver.

575
00:32:36,255 --> 00:32:37,489
We turned your feed back on.

576
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,362
Can you hear us?

577
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,138
- What are you doing?
- I'm checking the logs

578
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:53,772
for information.

579
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,145
Come on. Say something.

580
00:33:02,948 --> 00:33:04,316
There's-- There's nothing here.

581
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:09,588
What are you doing?

582
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,423
I don't know.
I'm just looking to see

583
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:12,591
if I can find something.

584
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:15,861
There's gotta be something.

585
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,697
- Where is he?
- Maybe he...

586
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,667
- escaped?
- Maybe he's dead.

587
00:33:22,801 --> 00:33:23,869
We have to tell the others.

588
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,438
I'm really disappointed
in both of you.

589
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,906
I thought
that you'd show more respect

590
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,475
for our system,
which we all agreed on,

591
00:33:29,608 --> 00:33:30,676
- by the way.
- We just felt this

592
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:32,010
was important enough
to make our own decision.

593
00:33:32,144 --> 00:33:33,579
That's not how we do things!

594
00:33:33,712 --> 00:33:36,148
We put you in charge
six years ago.

595
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:37,849
Maybe it's time we change
some of these old rules.

596
00:33:37,983 --> 00:33:39,918
Oh, I see how you wanna play it.
You wanna be in charge?

597
00:33:40,052 --> 00:33:41,687
Why does anybody have
to be in charge?

598
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,322
I think it's important
that we have a leader.

599
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:44,756
I mean, personally,
I find it comforting.

600
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,192
You can't figure out what's up
on your own?

601
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,259
Why are you antagonizing me?

602
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,560
- I'm just asking a question.
- No.

603
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:51,397
- Now you're being disingenuous.
- From where I'm sitting, Boston,

604
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:54,032
he-- He's not in charge
of fucking jack shit, man.

605
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:57,103
Look, I am really sorry
about your sleep cycle.

606
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:58,870
I wish there was something
I could do about it.

607
00:33:59,004 --> 00:34:01,740
Stop fucking changing!
You're fucking-- I can't!

608
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,041
Stop fucking changing,

609
00:34:03,175 --> 00:34:04,676
you broken piece
of fucking shit!

610
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,478
Houston, calm down.
You're not helping.

611
00:34:06,612 --> 00:34:07,813
I don't give a shit.
I've been awake

612
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,015
for three fucking days.
I'm losing my fucking mind.

613
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:13,852
This is fucking Orlando.
That's what it is.

614
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:14,886
What?
What are you talking about?

615
00:34:15,387 --> 00:34:18,257
He's fucking mad at me,
'cause I fucking voted him out

616
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,491
and now he's fucking with me.

617
00:34:19,691 --> 00:34:21,360
Houston, Houston,
you didn't vote against him.

618
00:34:21,493 --> 00:34:22,561
You didn't vote at all.
Remember?

619
00:34:22,694 --> 00:34:23,929
He voted himself out.

620
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,064
Whoever built this shit,
he's fucking tough, bro.

621
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:27,866
And he's fucking--

622
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,735
He's doing this shit to me
on purpose...

623
00:34:30,836 --> 00:34:32,138
'cause he fucking hates me.

624
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:34,973
I mean,
why else is my sleep cycle

625
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,074
fucking doing this shit?

626
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:38,544
There's a hundred reasons
it could be broken, Houston.

627
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,712
Please, sit down.

628
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,149
I don't like seeing you
like this.

629
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:49,655
Is there any chance

630
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:52,824
that Orlando can actually be
in there somewhere?

631
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:56,595
I mean, there's a possibility
he could be dead or...

632
00:34:58,029 --> 00:34:59,298
I don't know,
hiding from the camera,

633
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:01,400
but that doesn't seem
like his personality.

634
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,136
Well, what if he tried
to escape?

635
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:07,639
How could he escape?
The doors are locked.

636
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:15,147
Has anyone tried their door
since the terminal shut down?

637
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:28,960
What if it actually opens?

638
00:35:29,528 --> 00:35:31,263
You could be exposed.

639
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,372
Phoenix! Don't.

640
00:35:43,909 --> 00:35:45,377
Phoenix, wait-- Wait-- Wait!
No, no, no! What are--

641
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,845
Think about it!
Think about what you're doing.

642
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,046
Stop!

643
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:16,535
Hey.

644
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,104
Hi.

645
00:37:20,506 --> 00:37:23,509
I'm trying to be zen
about what you and Denver did.

646
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:26,678
We agreed on a hierarchy
way back when all this started,

647
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,747
but all of a sudden,
you and Denver,

648
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,849
you guys decided
to do your own thing.

649
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,784
Well, we've been in here
for years.

650
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,421
Things can't stay
the same forever.

651
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:37,289
But that doesn't mean
you should do whatever you want,

652
00:37:37,423 --> 00:37:38,590
- whenever you want.
- You know that lifting

653
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:40,326
the ban on Orlando
was the smart thing to do.

654
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:43,395
You sound more and more like him
as the years roll on.

655
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:44,730
- Like who?
- Denver.

656
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:46,665
I mean, you're two peas
in a pod.

657
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,066
Well, it's no secret
we're together.

658
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,134
"Together."

659
00:37:49,935 --> 00:37:51,437
I mean, what does
that even mean down here?

660
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,805
It means we see a future
with one another.

661
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,274
I will never understand,
why him?

662
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:00,245
- As opposed to you?
- No, I me-- I mean, that's--

663
00:38:00,479 --> 00:38:02,280
- that's not what I mean.
- I'm sorry to be blunt,

664
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:04,249
but it's absolutely none
of your business.

665
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,685
Look, I'm just worried
about you, okay?

666
00:38:07,919 --> 00:38:08,987
I mean, there's something
about him

667
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,722
that gives me the creeps.
Don't you see that?

668
00:38:10,856 --> 00:38:11,923
No, I don't.

669
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,493
He's never been anything
but supportive and loving.

670
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:15,827
You never even met him
in person.

671
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,597
I never met you in person
and you expect me to trust you.

672
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:21,132
What is this about, Boston?

673
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:23,234
Denver reminds me
of my dad,

674
00:38:24,035 --> 00:38:26,505
his looks, his voice,
his mannerisms, everything.

675
00:38:27,339 --> 00:38:28,374
You know, on the surface,

676
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,809
he's really friendly,
super smart, and charming,

677
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,578
but there was something
really fake about it all.

678
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:35,814
I mean, he was mean as shit
behind closed doors.

679
00:38:35,947 --> 00:38:39,250
You hit this switch
and, snap, he was a monster.

680
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:42,220
Listen, I always appreciate
your honesty,

681
00:38:42,854 --> 00:38:44,423
and thank you for your concern,

682
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:46,825
but I know Denver,

683
00:38:47,459 --> 00:38:48,960
and he is nothing like...

684
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:50,862
your father.

685
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,131
Okay.

686
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,154
What are you thinking
about right now?

687
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:51,089
You.

688
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:55,360
I know, but what,
specifically?

689
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,532
What it would feel like...

690
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,602
to have my hands all
over your body.

691
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:07,606
What else?

692
00:40:07,773 --> 00:40:09,808
What your lips would taste like.

693
00:40:11,042 --> 00:40:11,943
And?

694
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:17,649
What your...

695
00:40:18,817 --> 00:40:20,719
What you would feel like
underneath me.

696
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:26,592
Taste of your sweat. Mm.

697
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:37,869
How hard are you fucking me?

698
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,205
Oh, I'm fucking you so hard.

699
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,875
I'm thinking
about you looking back at me.

700
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,343
You gonna come?

701
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:47,513
I want you to come.

702
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:00,992
How was that?

703
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,328
Oh, man.

704
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:07,499
Oh, I hope nobody plays
that back.

705
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:11,803
Who cares if they do?

706
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:17,743
I love you so much.

707
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:36,427
Denver.

708
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:38,864
Hi.

709
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,198
Hi.

710
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,368
Mm.

711
00:41:46,772 --> 00:41:47,806
Are you reading?

712
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,041
No. No, I was just--
I was at the pool,

713
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,977
- thought I'd do a couple laps.
- Nice.

714
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:59,350
Oh, let me guess.
You're reading, uh, No Exit.

715
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:02,020
How many times
have you read that?

716
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,589
I don't know. I lost count.

717
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,157
- Wow. It's that good, huh?
- Yeah. I like it.

718
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:07,993
You know, it's a--
It's a classic.

719
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:10,862
What's up?

720
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:12,197
Do you remember
when we used to record

721
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,932
those private videos?

722
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:15,834
I do, yeah.

723
00:42:16,234 --> 00:42:19,638
What if Orlando made some
of his own while he was banned?

724
00:42:20,939 --> 00:42:22,407
Do you think
you could access them?

725
00:42:23,508 --> 00:42:25,877
Yeah. I mean,
if they're not hidden very well.

726
00:42:26,044 --> 00:42:26,978
Um...

727
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:32,083
While I'm doing this,
what made you...

728
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,485
wanna watch those videos?

729
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,589
Just wanted to think
about something nice.

730
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:40,726
So a video of me getting off,
that-- That did the trick?

731
00:42:41,059 --> 00:42:41,960
Oh, totally.

732
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,930
Okay. I got some, uh,
right here.

733
00:42:45,697 --> 00:42:48,266
Oh, I got a bunch. Okay, I--
I'll screen-share it with you.

734
00:42:49,267 --> 00:42:51,903
This one's
from a couple months ago.

735
00:42:53,438 --> 00:42:54,305
Play it.

736
00:43:02,213 --> 00:43:05,250
Day 121. I feel amazing.

737
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,053
I don't think I've ever been
in better shape.

738
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:09,220
He seems fine.

739
00:43:09,354 --> 00:43:10,421
Guess he wasn't lying
when he said

740
00:43:10,555 --> 00:43:11,723
he wouldn't miss us.

741
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:16,327
- Well, that was uneventful.
- Play a different one.

742
00:43:17,763 --> 00:43:18,797
Okay.

743
00:43:24,202 --> 00:43:27,706
I did not realize he was such
a workout enthusiast.

744
00:43:30,575 --> 00:43:31,910
Day 186.

745
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,779
Guess what.
I'm gonna be a frigging Hulk

746
00:43:33,912 --> 00:43:35,313
when I get out of here, huh?

747
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,216
Huh?

748
00:43:41,887 --> 00:43:43,621
Oh, I guess...

749
00:43:44,756 --> 00:43:46,157
There's--
There's hundreds of these.

750
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:48,794
Yeah, it's like Orlando's video
workout series.

751
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,395
Okay, here's the last one.

752
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,865
It's from a few days ago.
It's a much bigger file.

753
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:02,941
What is this?

754
00:44:04,109 --> 00:44:06,978
I don't know.

755
00:44:10,148 --> 00:44:12,383
Leave me alone!
Leave me alone!

756
00:44:17,455 --> 00:44:18,724
Wait. What just happened?

757
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,226
I don't understand.
He-- He's gone.

758
00:44:23,428 --> 00:44:24,830
- Oh, my God.
- What?

759
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,999
Look at his door.
His door is open.

760
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,836
What do you mean it's--
That's not--

761
00:44:31,002 --> 00:44:32,270
That's not possible.

762
00:44:33,805 --> 00:44:35,340
Wait. Go back to the static.

763
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:42,981
There. Did you hear that?

764
00:44:43,114 --> 00:44:44,315
- What?
- Yeah. What is that?

765
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:47,052
- Sounds like screaming.
- Is that Orlando?

766
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:50,188
- How long is this video?
- It's long.

767
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:52,023
There's five hours of this.

768
00:44:52,457 --> 00:44:54,225
- Go to the very end.
- Hang on.

769
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,079
See, what I think
is that Orlando set

770
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:15,546
this whole thing up, all right?
He's the one--

771
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:17,015
He's the one who put us in here.

772
00:45:17,182 --> 00:45:19,217
He tricked us into thinking
that the Saharan flu is real

773
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,019
and then he made us
wait down here for five years.

774
00:45:21,152 --> 00:45:22,720
- That's a little implausible.
- Houston,

775
00:45:22,854 --> 00:45:23,855
can you try to calm down?

776
00:45:24,022 --> 00:45:25,356
No, you guys don't see it,
but I do, okay?

777
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:26,691
It makes total fucking sense
to me now,

778
00:45:26,825 --> 00:45:27,893
all right?
This is what he wanted.

779
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:29,761
He wanted for all of us
to go fucking crazy, okay?

780
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,696
But I fucking-- I got it,
all right? I figured it out,

781
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33,231
'cause I-- I see what he's doing
to us.

782
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,833
Houston, how long
has it been since you slept?

783
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,167
Who the fuck knows, man?
Fuck sleep.

784
00:45:36,401 --> 00:45:37,903
I don't need sleep. Sleep is
for weak-ass motherfuckers

785
00:45:38,036 --> 00:45:40,171
like you guys, okay?
But Orlando's plan,

786
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:41,773
it blew up in his fucking face,
man,

787
00:45:41,907 --> 00:45:44,175
because I can see
what he fucking did to us, man.

788
00:45:44,309 --> 00:45:46,111
Okay, so this is
a big conspiracy theory.

789
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:47,445
No, it's not a theory, man.

790
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:49,347
- I know I'm right.
- You know you're right,

791
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,549
from what, from a--
A door shutting in a video?

792
00:45:51,682 --> 00:45:53,251
You're just too fucking afraid
to fucking admit it, man.

793
00:45:53,384 --> 00:45:54,585
Will you please stop cursing?

794
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,121
My goodness,
you're making my head spin.

795
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,388
Maybe you need an exorcism.

796
00:45:57,522 --> 00:45:59,257
Sweetie, how about contributing
something useful

797
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,391
to a stressful situation?

798
00:46:00,525 --> 00:46:02,293
- This video could be fake.
- How?

799
00:46:02,794 --> 00:46:03,895
- And why?
- That's my point.

800
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:05,563
- We don't know anything.
- So, what, let me guess.

801
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:07,298
Your idea is to-- To just
sit here and do nothing?

802
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:09,067
- What other choice do we have?
- Well, you could be

803
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,401
forcibly removed
like Orlando was.

804
00:46:10,535 --> 00:46:11,937
That is pure speculation.

805
00:46:12,070 --> 00:46:14,072
How many times
can you say the same thing?

806
00:46:14,205 --> 00:46:16,341
As many times as I have to
to get you to listen to reason.

807
00:46:16,474 --> 00:46:17,442
Maybe the terminal shut down,

808
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:18,844
because we don't
need it anymore.

809
00:46:19,144 --> 00:46:20,946
- Maybe the flu is gone.
- Yeah, Atlanta,

810
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:22,981
maybe we'll all be saved.

811
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:24,782
Maybe in a few days,
we'll just walk out of here

812
00:46:24,916 --> 00:46:25,851
and everything'll be perfect.

813
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:27,085
You know,
maybe your little angels

814
00:46:27,285 --> 00:46:29,154
- are alive and all grown up.
- Are you done yet?

815
00:46:29,554 --> 00:46:31,389
Are you done
with your little tantrum?

816
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,225
We need to take action
while we still have control.

817
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:36,227
Hey, Phoenix, man,
I hate to break it to you,

818
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:37,896
but we ain't in control of shit,
all right?

819
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,765
Orlando, Orlando's running
this whole fucking game, man.

820
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,567
- He got us beat.
- I hope you're right, Houston.

821
00:46:43,534 --> 00:46:44,602
I really do.

822
00:46:45,236 --> 00:46:46,671
Because that's better
than the alternative.

823
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,006
Well, do you have a plan,
Phoenix?

824
00:46:48,139 --> 00:46:49,674
Yeah. I think we should find
a way out.

825
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:50,942
You all sound crazy to me.

826
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:52,777
Maybe the lock that seals
the door can be broken.

827
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,779
Sudden depressurization
could be fatal.

828
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:56,747
Well, that's a risk
that I'm willing to take.

829
00:46:56,882 --> 00:46:58,850
- In here, we're safe.
- We're not safe

830
00:46:58,984 --> 00:47:00,651
- and that video is proof.
- It doesn't prove

831
00:47:00,785 --> 00:47:02,120
anything. I'm still
not convinced it's real.

832
00:47:02,253 --> 00:47:03,654
What else do you need?

833
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:05,991
We don't know what's going on.

834
00:47:06,124 --> 00:47:08,293
- We have to do something.
- Okay. Let's vote.

835
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:10,195
I don't need your permission
to make my own plan.

836
00:47:10,328 --> 00:47:12,363
- Can I have two votes?
- Houston, concentrate.

837
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:15,033
Stop, officer. Don't shoot me.

838
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,502
I used to say
that shit all the time

839
00:47:17,635 --> 00:47:19,204
when I was a kid.
Hey, you guys ever have

840
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:20,805
- the cops put a gun on you?
- Houston!

841
00:47:20,939 --> 00:47:22,240
Fuck, man! Fuck, yeah! We escape

842
00:47:22,373 --> 00:47:23,975
and go find that
lying motherfucker, Orlando!

843
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:25,877
We skin him alive! Sounds like
a fuckin' plan to me!

844
00:47:26,011 --> 00:47:27,478
- He's lost his mind.
- I lost my mind,

845
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:30,048
then I found it.
It's right here in my head.

846
00:47:30,916 --> 00:47:32,951
Listen, we can't make
any decisions

847
00:47:33,084 --> 00:47:34,385
with Houston like this.

848
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:27,973
Good evening.

849
00:48:30,408 --> 00:48:31,276
Hi.

850
00:48:32,143 --> 00:48:33,211
What are you doing up?

851
00:48:34,712 --> 00:48:36,447
You know, just checking in.

852
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:39,450
- Can you even see anything?
- Sort of.

853
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:42,353
Figured I'd do Boston the favor
of not searching...

854
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,590
- directly in front of his face.
- That's very sweet.

855
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:47,292
Did you find anything yet?

856
00:48:48,226 --> 00:48:49,894
Nope, not really.

857
00:48:53,164 --> 00:48:55,466
Uh, you know,
it is the middle of the night,

858
00:48:55,700 --> 00:48:57,735
so maybe you should try
and get some sleep.

859
00:48:58,103 --> 00:48:59,037
Yeah.

860
00:48:59,604 --> 00:49:00,705
I can't really sleep.

861
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:02,707
What's up?

862
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,276
I was trying to remember...

863
00:49:06,244 --> 00:49:09,280
what everyone's real name is.

864
00:49:10,148 --> 00:49:11,482
There's, uh, Barry.

865
00:49:12,483 --> 00:49:14,152
- Raymond.
- Olivia.

866
00:49:14,752 --> 00:49:16,487
- Cedric.
- And then...

867
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:19,757
Houston.

868
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:21,926
- What's his real name?
- Huh.

869
00:49:22,327 --> 00:49:23,928
I don't think he ever told us.

870
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:26,697
Do you hear that?

871
00:49:27,432 --> 00:49:28,433
Yeah, what is that?

872
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:37,442
Houston.

873
00:49:38,243 --> 00:49:39,577
Oh, no.

874
00:49:48,586 --> 00:49:49,820
Houston.

875
00:49:49,954 --> 00:49:51,689
What is going on?

876
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,624
Oh, shit.

877
00:49:59,397 --> 00:50:00,865
Houston, stop.

878
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:32,830
Houston.

879
00:51:35,693 --> 00:51:36,794
What the...

880
00:51:46,704 --> 00:51:48,539
You still think we're safe
in here, Boston?

881
00:52:05,856 --> 00:52:06,891
I'm scared.

882
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,595
Me, too.

883
00:52:14,064 --> 00:52:15,466
Who are they?

884
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:17,468
I don't know. I don't...

885
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,972
People immune
to the Saharan flu? I...

886
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,810
How are they
finding the bunkers?

887
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,283
Maybe they heard
Houston screaming.

888
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,524
I don't know. Let's just...

889
00:52:41,892 --> 00:52:43,594
Let's try and get some rest,
okay?

890
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:46,764
- Okay.
- Good night.

891
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,098
Good night.

892
00:53:37,014 --> 00:53:37,882
No.

893
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:44,489
Phoenix.

894
00:53:47,157 --> 00:53:48,359
Don't move.

895
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:51,662
- What's wrong?
- Slowly look down...

896
00:53:52,196 --> 00:53:54,832
but be very careful.

897
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:02,172
You guys scared
the hell out of me.

898
00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,343
It's just a little rat. Hi.

899
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,345
Don't touch it.
It could be sick.

900
00:54:07,478 --> 00:54:09,414
No.
Only humans can get Saharan flu.

901
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:12,717
- I'm talking about rabies.
- Hey there, little guy.

902
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:14,552
Come here.

903
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:24,462
How did it get there?

904
00:54:24,762 --> 00:54:26,163
Aren't these things supposed
to be sealed?

905
00:54:26,297 --> 00:54:28,232
Oh, my God, Atlanta.
It's a miracle.

906
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:30,301
No, no, Phoenix, Phoenix,
she's right.

907
00:54:30,435 --> 00:54:32,837
You need to be careful.
Your bunker is not airtight.

908
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:34,305
I think this is my fault.

909
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:37,775
I found this panel yesterday
and tried to pry it open.

910
00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:40,177
The rat must have knocked it out
when it came in.

911
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:43,348
- What were you looking for?
- A way out.

912
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,052
"Emergency vent."

913
00:54:56,527 --> 00:54:57,595
Can you see anything?

914
00:54:58,062 --> 00:54:59,730
No. There's nothing.

915
00:55:01,866 --> 00:55:03,468
Do you guys have the same panel?

916
00:55:22,353 --> 00:55:24,188
I don't-- I don't understand.

917
00:55:24,321 --> 00:55:25,956
- This doesn't make any sense.
- You know,

918
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,458
maybe it's some kind
of ventilation system

919
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,159
- that connects all the bunkers.
- Oh, yeah.

920
00:55:29,494 --> 00:55:30,795
Yeah, there's ventilation ducts

921
00:55:30,928 --> 00:55:32,697
across
the entire continental U.S.

922
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:33,998
You know what?
Stop being an asshole.

923
00:55:34,131 --> 00:55:35,132
I'm just brainstorming.

924
00:55:35,466 --> 00:55:36,967
Yeah, but aren't we
30 feet underground?

925
00:55:37,101 --> 00:55:38,703
Yeah, that's--
That's my point, okay?

926
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:41,138
Th-- There should be dirt
on the other side of this wall,

927
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,641
not an open space
and definitely not a vent.

928
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:47,177
Does this make you guys happy...
asking all these questions?

929
00:55:47,311 --> 00:55:49,680
Like, do you feel like
you're making progress?

930
00:55:49,814 --> 00:55:51,516
Do you feel like you're solving
some mystery?

931
00:55:51,649 --> 00:55:53,884
So tell me, what is your idea,
hmm, Chicago?

932
00:55:54,018 --> 00:55:55,486
Nothing. Do nothing.

933
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,622
Same shit's gonna happen,
regardless.

934
00:55:57,755 --> 00:55:59,123
For once, I agree with Chicago.

935
00:56:00,024 --> 00:56:01,626
- I think we should wait it out.
- Of course,

936
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03,160
you think we should wait.
That's your answer

937
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,229
to everything!
Sit back and wait.

938
00:56:05,430 --> 00:56:06,831
Well, you know what?
We've been listening to you

939
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,867
this entire time and every day
has gotten progressively worse.

940
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,236
So, what, you think we could have
done something about Orlando?

941
00:56:12,537 --> 00:56:14,038
You think we could have done
something about Houston?

942
00:56:14,171 --> 00:56:15,372
About the rat? About fucking...

943
00:56:15,506 --> 00:56:16,707
- Stop arguing!
- ...any of this?

944
00:56:17,975 --> 00:56:19,444
What we need right now
is more information.

945
00:56:19,744 --> 00:56:22,212
Great idea. Just simply acquire
more information.

946
00:56:22,346 --> 00:56:23,681
Look, we know
that we're connected

947
00:56:23,814 --> 00:56:25,015
to the Domain network.

948
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:27,084
There has gotta be a way
to access data

949
00:56:27,217 --> 00:56:28,619
- from the other bunkers.
- Even if it works,

950
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:30,187
- what will it accomplish?
- I don't know, but maybe

951
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,722
we can contact someone else.

952
00:56:31,856 --> 00:56:33,891
That could work. I'll--
I'll get on it.

953
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,196
Now, I think everyone else
should start going

954
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,798
- around the bunker--
- Who put you in charge?

955
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,367
I'm taking charge,
because no one else is doing it.

956
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:45,135
- Maybe we should vote.
- Boston, stop wasting time.

957
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:46,904
- Look, I'm the one that got--
- Stop!

958
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,842
- The system is collapsing.
- The system is collapsed.

959
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:54,011
Which is why we need
to find a way out of here.

960
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,547
- How?
- I'm not sure.

961
00:56:57,181 --> 00:56:59,116
An emergency release?
Something.

962
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:01,051
I don't know.
There's gotta be a way.

963
00:57:01,318 --> 00:57:03,387
Okay. Okay, okay, just,

964
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,189
you know, tell me
where to start. I'll help.

965
00:57:05,355 --> 00:57:07,558
Be creative. Try-- Try anything.

966
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:14,131
Boston, you, too.

967
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:19,203
- Chicago, you gonna help us out?
- Sorry.

968
00:57:20,237 --> 00:57:22,473
- I don't do jailbreaks.
- Come on.

969
00:57:23,608 --> 00:57:25,810
- You're a smart guy.
- Leave me alone.

970
00:57:28,145 --> 00:57:29,480
What exactly are we looking
for again?

971
00:57:29,614 --> 00:57:30,981
Can you guys--
Can you just keep it down?

972
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,082
I'm trying to focus.

973
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,318
Oh, I'm sorry, princess.

974
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:44,254
Atlanta, what are you doing?

975
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:47,091
The Supplival has to be coming
from someplace.

976
00:58:47,825 --> 00:58:50,194
I think it's connected
to that pipe back there.

977
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,929
I'm gonna break through.
I think there's something

978
00:58:52,062 --> 00:58:54,164
- on the other side.
- Atlanta, if you break that,

979
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,700
you could cut access
to your food.

980
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:57,167
Yeah, I agree
with Boston.

981
00:58:57,301 --> 00:58:59,036
I know I told you
to try anything but--

982
00:58:59,169 --> 00:59:00,137
No.

983
00:59:00,938 --> 00:59:03,974
No, guys. Listen, if I'm gonna
end up starving to death,

984
00:59:04,308 --> 00:59:06,510
then I guess that was God's plan
for me all along.

985
00:59:26,330 --> 00:59:28,232
- What do you see?
- Nothing.

986
00:59:29,033 --> 00:59:31,368
It's just empty space.

987
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:36,040
- You can't see anything?
- No. It's pitch-black.

988
00:59:38,208 --> 00:59:41,578
But there's too much space
on the other side of this wall.

989
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:43,981
It doesn't make sense.

990
00:59:50,755 --> 00:59:51,989
Atlanta, your door.

991
00:59:56,060 --> 00:59:56,994
Atlanta!

992
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:09,473
O Lord, make me brave,

993
01:00:09,840 --> 01:00:11,375
brave enough to face the dark,

994
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:13,443
the dark that works
to pull me in.

995
01:00:13,878 --> 01:00:15,379
Help me to retain my sight,

996
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:17,114
to see that from the dark
comes light.

997
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,451
Oh, no. No. Oh, God.

998
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:39,036
To know that from the dark
comes light.

999
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,432
Chicago...

1000
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:10,801
what are you doing?

1001
01:01:21,445 --> 01:01:22,512
- Denver!
- What?

1002
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:24,715
- Atlanta's gone.
- What? When?

1003
01:01:25,149 --> 01:01:26,483
Look at Chicago's feed.

1004
01:01:34,158 --> 01:01:35,492
Is that Supplival?

1005
01:01:38,628 --> 01:01:40,197
He was starving himself.

1006
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:50,274
Chicago, please, don't do this.

1007
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:52,242
We can get through this,
Chicago.

1008
01:01:52,642 --> 01:01:53,844
Nobody's getting through.

1009
01:01:55,012 --> 01:01:56,180
We need you.

1010
01:01:57,381 --> 01:01:58,348
That's not true.

1011
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:02,386
Chicago, you don't wanna
do this. You don't.

1012
01:02:04,889 --> 01:02:07,091
I never wanted
to do anything more.

1013
01:02:18,402 --> 01:02:19,503
Goodbye, guys.

1014
01:02:20,170 --> 01:02:23,673
Please, Chicago, don't do this.
No. No! No.

1015
01:02:24,875 --> 01:02:27,845
No.

1016
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:00,444
God.

1017
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,348
I can't look at that.

1018
01:03:06,616 --> 01:03:07,617
Then don't.

1019
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:10,921
Why are you so fucking cold?

1020
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:15,059
I'm dealing with this
in my own way, all right?

1021
01:03:15,192 --> 01:03:18,095
Why don't you show some emotion,
you fucking robot?

1022
01:03:18,362 --> 01:03:20,664
He was our friend.

1023
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:30,941
Hi.

1024
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:35,279
Well, I hate to bring
this down even further,

1025
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:36,847
but I have some new information.

1026
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:38,949
New information
would be good right now.

1027
01:03:39,516 --> 01:03:41,151
Well, that depends
on your point of view.

1028
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,188
So, the bunkers,
they're all connected, right?

1029
01:03:44,321 --> 01:03:46,156
Every bunker in the Network
has its own feed.

1030
01:03:46,290 --> 01:03:48,292
That's 500,000 feeds.

1031
01:03:48,859 --> 01:03:51,328
So the Domain,
what it does is it limits access

1032
01:03:51,628 --> 01:03:54,064
to the seven people
in your group.

1033
01:03:54,464 --> 01:03:56,666
The feeds, they're still there
but you just can't see 'em.

1034
01:03:57,267 --> 01:03:58,668
Well,
can you access them now?

1035
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:00,270
Yeah. I already did.

1036
01:04:01,505 --> 01:04:03,840
I can only pull 'em up one
at a time. This is, uh,

1037
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,175
this is a random one.

1038
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,512
I'm-- I'm assuming
they already took this person.

1039
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:13,183
Who is that?

1040
01:04:13,951 --> 01:04:16,053
- No idea.
- Why can't we hear him?

1041
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,222
I couldn't locate
the audio streams, video only,

1042
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,024
so we can't communicate
with them and...

1043
01:04:21,125 --> 01:04:22,192
they can't see us.

1044
01:04:23,928 --> 01:04:26,063
- So this is live.
- Yeah.

1045
01:04:28,365 --> 01:04:29,333
Wow.

1046
01:04:29,799 --> 01:04:33,037
It is so weird to see a new face
after all these years.

1047
01:04:53,490 --> 01:04:54,558
God.

1048
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:56,927
I've seen a lot of suicides.

1049
01:05:04,368 --> 01:05:07,604
This-- This-- This is just...

1050
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:10,907
- I don't know.
- There's more.

1051
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:12,376
What?

1052
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:14,711
There's only
a thousand feeds

1053
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:16,213
coming from the main server.

1054
01:05:17,214 --> 01:05:19,916
- So what?
- There should be 500,000,

1055
01:05:20,684 --> 01:05:21,685
one from each bunker.

1056
01:05:22,052 --> 01:05:24,554
Is it possible that you
just can't access them all?

1057
01:05:24,688 --> 01:05:27,191
No. No. I mean,
I-- I didn't think

1058
01:05:27,824 --> 01:05:28,925
that it was possible,

1059
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,261
so I-- I triple-checked it
but I'm telling you...

1060
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:34,631
there's only a thousand bunkers.

1061
01:05:34,999 --> 01:05:38,035
- What does that mean?
- It means they lied to us.

1062
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:48,012
We have to get out of here.

1063
01:05:48,645 --> 01:05:49,513
How?

1064
01:05:52,916 --> 01:05:54,418
When we were searching
the bunkers,

1065
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,521
I found this cluster
of wires connecting...

1066
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,823
the door to the computer.

1067
01:05:59,990 --> 01:06:01,191
So we-- If we cut it,

1068
01:06:01,325 --> 01:06:02,592
the computer loses control
of the door?

1069
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,794
Yeah. It just might unlock it.

1070
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,797
Or we cut power to a crucial
life-support function,

1071
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:10,834
and we starve or suffocate
in total darkness.

1072
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:12,969
I have to get out of here
on my own terms.

1073
01:06:13,737 --> 01:06:15,272
I don't wanna be pulled out
like the others.

1074
01:06:15,539 --> 01:06:17,741
Well, let's say we do
make it out of here, all right?

1075
01:06:17,874 --> 01:06:20,744
And we don't contract
the Saharan flu within hours.

1076
01:06:20,877 --> 01:06:23,080
We're still thousands
of miles apart

1077
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:24,681
in a broken-down society.

1078
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,116
Well, we need a meeting place.

1079
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:28,052
We'd have to travel on foot.

1080
01:06:28,552 --> 01:06:30,154
Maybe we can find
working vehicles.

1081
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:32,522
That's-- That's a huge maybe.

1082
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:33,957
All right.

1083
01:06:34,758 --> 01:06:35,959
Four Corners Monument,

1084
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:37,794
where Arizona, Colorado,

1085
01:06:37,961 --> 01:06:39,263
Utah and New Mexico meet.

1086
01:06:39,629 --> 01:06:41,631
No, that's too remote.
That's not safe.

1087
01:06:41,898 --> 01:06:43,200
That's not safe at all.

1088
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:46,370
- I'll come to you.
- To Phoenix?

1089
01:06:48,305 --> 01:06:49,239
That's a whole state away.

1090
01:06:49,473 --> 01:06:50,907
I know, but I--
I'll make it work.

1091
01:06:51,141 --> 01:06:52,276
Is there a--
A government building,

1092
01:06:52,409 --> 01:06:54,010
something
that's centrally located?

1093
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,480
- Yeah, City Hall.
- That's where we'll meet.

1094
01:06:57,147 --> 01:06:59,183
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

1095
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:03,053
What about me?

1096
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:07,023
You-- You can come, too.

1097
01:07:07,457 --> 01:07:09,393
I'm 3,000 miles away.

1098
01:07:14,831 --> 01:07:15,832
Never mind.

1099
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,502
Just excess baggage.

1100
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:20,204
I'll figure out
my own situation.

1101
01:07:20,837 --> 01:07:22,038
I'm sorry, Boston.

1102
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:25,375
- Just one last thing, though.
- Sure.

1103
01:07:26,810 --> 01:07:27,877
We have to vote.

1104
01:07:29,813 --> 01:07:32,182
Seriously? You're still holding
on to that?

1105
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,717
It's what we do.

1106
01:07:34,684 --> 01:07:36,086
It's what we did.

1107
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:37,821
There's only three of us.

1108
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,224
Pretty sure you know
how the vote turns out.

1109
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:42,326
Please.

1110
01:07:44,128 --> 01:07:45,129
Just one last time.

1111
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:47,564
Okay.

1112
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,400
All those in favor of an escape.

1113
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:55,639
Well, that's it, then.

1114
01:07:59,876 --> 01:08:00,977
Did you find the wires?

1115
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:03,947
Yeah.

1116
01:08:06,183 --> 01:08:07,151
Let's do this.

1117
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:37,881
Well, it did something.

1118
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:41,285
I'm gonna try the door.

1119
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:49,859
I'm going up.

1120
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:51,995
No, Phoenix, wait!

1121
01:09:04,641 --> 01:09:05,675
I'll find you...

1122
01:09:06,643 --> 01:09:07,611
no matter what.

1123
01:09:12,081 --> 01:09:13,217
I love you, Phoenix.

1124
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,321
I love you, too.

1125
01:11:15,071 --> 01:11:16,139
You're here.

1126
01:11:19,208 --> 01:11:20,344
Is this real?

1127
01:11:21,978 --> 01:11:23,079
I'm...

1128
01:11:35,258 --> 01:11:37,093
Oh, this is real.

1129
01:12:04,187 --> 01:12:06,523
This feels like a dream.

1130
01:12:10,026 --> 01:12:11,961
If this was a dream,
I wouldn't be here.

1131
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,367
Yeah.

1132
01:12:18,535 --> 01:12:19,536
Hi.

1133
01:12:26,443 --> 01:12:27,811
You're taller than I expected.

1134
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:34,317
How did we wind up next
to each other?

1135
01:12:34,751 --> 01:12:35,685
I don't know.

1136
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:37,621
I don't know either.

1137
01:12:38,755 --> 01:12:40,189
I don't remember
this place.

1138
01:12:44,027 --> 01:12:45,028
Fifty-seven.

1139
01:13:00,143 --> 01:13:01,077
I mean,
maybe they moved us.

1140
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,612
No, we would have known that.

1141
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:06,049
Maybe we were here all along.

1142
01:13:15,759 --> 01:13:18,127
The others have
to be here somewhere, right?

1143
01:13:20,664 --> 01:13:23,266
Yeah, I... I don't know.

1144
01:13:26,269 --> 01:13:27,270
There.

1145
01:14:55,992 --> 01:14:57,160
Oh, my God.

1146
01:14:59,295 --> 01:15:00,296
Oh, my...

1147
01:15:05,334 --> 01:15:06,469
Phoenix.

1148
01:15:06,770 --> 01:15:09,172
Phoenix, come here.
Look over there.

1149
01:15:21,718 --> 01:15:22,819
Get down.

1150
01:15:27,156 --> 01:15:28,157
What are we gonna do?

1151
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,259
We gotta find a way to get out
of here.

1152
01:15:30,493 --> 01:15:31,995
- No, I want answers.
- No, Phoenix,

1153
01:15:32,161 --> 01:15:33,529
we need to find a way out.

1154
01:15:39,002 --> 01:15:40,336
Someone knows what's going on.

1155
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,738
Look, I will distract them.

1156
01:15:41,971 --> 01:15:43,039
Wait. What? Why?

1157
01:15:43,506 --> 01:15:45,709
Because they are blocking
the only exit.

1158
01:15:48,277 --> 01:15:49,345
Hey!

1159
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:51,180
Go.

1160
01:15:56,653 --> 01:15:57,821
Wait, wait, wait.

1161
01:15:58,387 --> 01:15:59,322
Okay.

1162
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:27,617
Phoenix, we shouldn't be here.

1163
01:16:29,018 --> 01:16:30,119
We need to go.

1164
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,057
Not until I know
what this place is.

1165
01:16:49,773 --> 01:16:50,907
Look.

1166
01:17:04,788 --> 01:17:05,789
There.

1167
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:11,761
Phoenix,
you sure about this?

1168
01:17:14,430 --> 01:17:15,665
Phoenix.

1169
01:17:34,250 --> 01:17:37,286
Phoenix, we need to go. Come on.
Let's go.

1170
01:17:39,322 --> 01:17:41,657
- Kimberly.
- Nadine?

1171
01:17:44,193 --> 01:17:45,528
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
- Sit down, Dean.

1172
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,063
What are you doing?
Put that down.

1173
01:17:47,196 --> 01:17:48,464
Put that down. Calm down.
Calm down, okay?

1174
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:50,666
- Don't point that at him.
- Kimberly, get out of the way.

1175
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:52,201
What are you doing?
This is crazy.

1176
01:17:52,335 --> 01:17:54,070
He is extremely dangerous.

1177
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:55,905
He's not dangerous.
I know him. It's okay.

1178
01:17:56,039 --> 01:17:57,506
You don't know him at all.

1179
01:17:57,807 --> 01:17:59,375
- Okay.
- Okay, sit down.

1180
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,377
All right.

1181
01:18:02,045 --> 01:18:03,046
Okay.

1182
01:18:07,016 --> 01:18:08,484
I just want to know
what's going on.

1183
01:18:09,819 --> 01:18:11,220
This is an experiment.

1184
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,023
Kimberly,
you're still in prison.

1185
01:18:14,490 --> 01:18:17,626
You really expect
us to believe this bullshit?

1186
01:18:25,168 --> 01:18:27,403
- The epidemic was a lie.
- No.

1187
01:18:28,504 --> 01:18:30,807
No, it wasn't a lie.
It was a story.

1188
01:18:32,141 --> 01:18:33,176
I was...

1189
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,545
I was trying to create
a better life.

1190
01:18:37,113 --> 01:18:38,181
And it worked.

1191
01:18:39,182 --> 01:18:40,249
It really worked.

1192
01:18:40,784 --> 01:18:43,019
What are you talking about?
I saw the news coverage.

1193
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:45,354
- Yeah.
- We created that content

1194
01:18:45,488 --> 01:18:46,689
to make it more believable.

1195
01:18:46,823 --> 01:18:49,425
- "Content." Jesus.
- I don't understand.

1196
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:51,527
How did you get me
from prison...

1197
01:18:52,295 --> 01:18:53,329
to my bunker?

1198
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:56,766
Oh, we slipped sedatives
into your food,

1199
01:18:57,801 --> 01:18:58,802
flew you from Arizona,

1200
01:18:58,935 --> 01:19:00,203
and installed you here
the next day.

1201
01:19:01,004 --> 01:19:02,038
Where are we?

1202
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:04,573
California.

1203
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:06,843
You're fucking lying, bitch.

1204
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:13,216
Why have you been forcing people
out of their bunkers?

1205
01:19:15,618 --> 01:19:17,386
They're shutting down Domain.

1206
01:19:18,287 --> 01:19:20,790
- Why?
- Because you banned Orlando.

1207
01:19:21,624 --> 01:19:23,893
- Who even knows about that?
- Everyone!

1208
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:26,295
Someone leaked the video.

1209
01:19:27,063 --> 01:19:28,798
It blew up
on the Internet.

1210
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:30,633
It was national news for weeks.

1211
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:34,470
The media called you
"The Penthouse Prisoners."

1212
01:19:34,603 --> 01:19:37,106
They couldn't believe
how much freedom you had

1213
01:19:37,240 --> 01:19:40,810
in the prison environment.
It was ridiculous.

1214
01:19:41,277 --> 01:19:44,347
We were always in control.
That's not all.

1215
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:46,015
The public hated
that you didn't know

1216
01:19:46,149 --> 01:19:47,750
you were in prison.
They thought the bunkers

1217
01:19:47,884 --> 01:19:48,918
were too nice.

1218
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51,287
They thought you were
getting off too lightly.

1219
01:19:51,720 --> 01:19:54,590
Never underestimate
humanity's capacity

1220
01:19:55,124 --> 01:19:56,826
to be punitive.

1221
01:19:57,726 --> 01:19:59,262
So they're just
shutting it down?

1222
01:20:00,463 --> 01:20:01,464
Yeah.

1223
01:20:03,299 --> 01:20:04,500
The public spoke.

1224
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:06,936
The government
was only too happy to comply,

1225
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,272
so they're pulling everyone out,

1226
01:20:09,505 --> 01:20:11,474
making some changes
in the bunkers and...

1227
01:20:12,408 --> 01:20:14,243
putting you back in
until they can find a space

1228
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:18,414
- for you in the prison system.
- Oh, you fucking lying cunt.

1229
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:22,952
- What is wrong with you?
- You're an escaped convict.

1230
01:20:23,786 --> 01:20:26,155
I have every legal right
to shoot you.

1231
01:20:26,289 --> 01:20:27,756
- Well, then do it.
- Denver, stop.

1232
01:20:28,057 --> 01:20:29,325
No. Shut up, Phoenix.

1233
01:20:30,293 --> 01:20:32,161
She's full of shit
and I'm calling her on it.

1234
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:33,997
Why don't you tell her
why you're here?

1235
01:20:41,938 --> 01:20:43,172
Why are you here?

1236
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,942
Denver.

1237
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:49,478
- You don't wanna know.
- It's okay. You can tell me.

1238
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:51,314
Trust me.

1239
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,618
You're my one mistake.

1240
01:20:58,754 --> 01:20:59,889
Why me?

1241
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:02,325
Why any of us?

1242
01:21:07,296 --> 01:21:09,465
Oh, you were one
of a thousand prisoners

1243
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:13,369
that I specially selected
for the program.

1244
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:17,540
Your psych evaluations indicated

1245
01:21:17,673 --> 01:21:21,010
that you would be very unlikely
to reveal your histories,

1246
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:25,214
and you'd be the most likely
to believe the flu scenario.

1247
01:21:25,514 --> 01:21:27,050
I reasoned
that if we could control

1248
01:21:27,183 --> 01:21:28,617
your physical contact,

1249
01:21:28,751 --> 01:21:30,954
that you would put your past
behind you

1250
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:32,855
and create new identities.

1251
01:21:33,589 --> 01:21:34,924
And you did.

1252
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:37,961
Well, we were all lying
to each other.

1253
01:21:38,394 --> 01:21:40,563
Honey, everybody lies.

1254
01:21:42,698 --> 01:21:43,866
What did they do?

1255
01:21:44,733 --> 01:21:47,236
- Are you sure you wanna know?
- Yes.

1256
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:49,238
They're my friends.

1257
01:21:53,376 --> 01:21:56,812
Well, Raymond Voss
was a career criminal.

1258
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:58,647
He was in and out
of prison his whole life.

1259
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:01,750
I think you know the rest
of his resume.

1260
01:22:04,787 --> 01:22:06,755
Hector Gonzales was in a gang.

1261
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:10,126
He was directly responsible
for at least 20 murders.

1262
01:22:12,695 --> 01:22:15,431
Olivia Michaels was suffering
from postpartum depression

1263
01:22:15,564 --> 01:22:17,433
and she drowned
her three little girls,

1264
01:22:17,566 --> 01:22:20,469
right before she attempted
to commit suicide with pills.

1265
01:22:22,105 --> 01:22:25,308
Cedric Jackson was a prostitute
and a drug addict.

1266
01:22:25,441 --> 01:22:29,212
He murdered innumerable men
who paid to have sex with him,

1267
01:22:29,345 --> 01:22:31,614
stealing their cash,
their jewelry.

1268
01:22:33,049 --> 01:22:35,418
Barry O'Malley robbed a bank
with his two brothers.

1269
01:22:35,584 --> 01:22:37,920
Afterwards, they were trying
to divide the heist

1270
01:22:38,054 --> 01:22:41,557
and he murdered them both,
execution style.

1271
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,464
And Denver?

1272
01:22:52,301 --> 01:22:53,436
Please tell me.

1273
01:22:55,538 --> 01:22:59,142
Dean Atkins stalked
and murdered 11 women

1274
01:22:59,575 --> 01:23:03,146
that he met
on various dating websites.

1275
01:23:24,333 --> 01:23:27,736
You know, I've heard
about people like you, Nadine.

1276
01:23:28,971 --> 01:23:30,339
Sure you're not a fan?

1277
01:23:32,941 --> 01:23:34,477
Seem to know a lot about us.

1278
01:23:36,045 --> 01:23:39,682
This program is my life,
my baby.

1279
01:23:39,948 --> 01:23:42,885
I watched all
of you every day for six years.

1280
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:45,154
I know everything
about all of you.

1281
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:48,757
I gave you a purpose,
a reason to live.

1282
01:23:48,891 --> 01:23:50,259
I gave you hope,

1283
01:23:50,826 --> 01:23:54,563
an opportunity to--
To put your past behind you

1284
01:23:54,697 --> 01:23:56,532
and to create something new,

1285
01:23:56,665 --> 01:23:59,768
a way to live your lives
in a humane atmosphere

1286
01:23:59,902 --> 01:24:02,205
instead of some prison
where the inmates are raped

1287
01:24:02,338 --> 01:24:03,272
and murdered.

1288
01:24:04,407 --> 01:24:05,674
This is worse.

1289
01:24:05,974 --> 01:24:07,743
It's only worse
because you found out.

1290
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,712
You were never supposed
to find out.

1291
01:24:11,214 --> 01:24:14,283
- Ignorance is bliss, huh?
- Something like that.

1292
01:24:15,318 --> 01:24:16,752
- Nadine!
- In here.

1293
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:18,421
Hands up.

1294
01:24:22,858 --> 01:24:24,493
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

1295
01:24:24,860 --> 01:24:26,429
- Get up.
- Get off--

1296
01:24:26,562 --> 01:24:28,264
Wait. Wait--

1297
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:19,782
No.

1298
01:25:32,561 --> 01:25:33,829
I'm here for you, Phoenix.

1299
01:25:53,282 --> 01:25:54,383
Hi.

1300
01:25:57,620 --> 01:25:59,555
You know, you've been out
for hours.

1301
01:26:05,494 --> 01:26:07,196
Okay, I get it.

1302
01:26:08,664 --> 01:26:10,566
The silent treatment, huh?

1303
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:18,073
You know, Phoenix,
I'm still the same guy.

1304
01:26:19,342 --> 01:26:20,709
I actually believed you.

1305
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:23,512
Believe what?

1306
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:25,514
That you loved me.

1307
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,216
Oh, I love you, Phoenix.

1308
01:26:28,517 --> 01:26:31,854
I love you in my way.

1309
01:26:37,993 --> 01:26:39,628
Did you love the women
you killed?

1310
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:43,666
Yeah, for a while, sure.

1311
01:26:49,272 --> 01:26:50,573
Then why'd you kill them?

1312
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,878
I can't explain that to you

1313
01:26:56,011 --> 01:26:58,547
in a way that you would find
accessible.

1314
01:27:01,016 --> 01:27:02,418
You knew that we were still
in prison.

1315
01:27:02,685 --> 01:27:04,353
Well,
I suspected it once you told me

1316
01:27:04,487 --> 01:27:05,588
about your mommy.

1317
01:27:06,755 --> 01:27:09,224
Of course,
I knew my own history...

1318
01:27:09,692 --> 01:27:11,527
...then Orlando.

1319
01:27:13,362 --> 01:27:16,064
I mean, three convicted felons
in one place, that's...

1320
01:27:16,799 --> 01:27:18,667
a little bit too much
of a coincidence.

1321
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,035
So,
why didn't you say something?

1322
01:27:20,168 --> 01:27:21,103
It was fun.

1323
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:24,172
It was fascinating
watching it all play out.

1324
01:27:26,008 --> 01:27:27,576
You're a sociopath.

1325
01:27:29,211 --> 01:27:30,746
Yeah, that's what they say.

1326
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:33,549
And I was just another victim?

1327
01:27:35,384 --> 01:27:37,386
No. You were special.

1328
01:27:41,724 --> 01:27:44,427
Because you were the one
I could never have

1329
01:27:44,893 --> 01:27:46,261
the way I truly wanted.

1330
01:28:06,214 --> 01:28:07,950
On your feet. Let's move.

1331
01:28:56,131 --> 01:28:58,133
Well, well, well. Looky here.

1332
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:02,204
We got the merry band
of frigging hypocrites. Hah!

1333
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:06,609
Is that you, Atlanta?

1334
01:29:08,143 --> 01:29:09,945
Now, what'd you do,
Atlanta, huh?

1335
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:12,481
You must have done
something pretty bad

1336
01:29:12,615 --> 01:29:13,816
to be put in here, right?

1337
01:29:15,584 --> 01:29:17,853
Hey, I wonder if it had anything
to do with those little angels.

1338
01:29:25,594 --> 01:29:29,331
I guess I'll be seeing y'all
in hell. Woo!

1339
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,568
Come on.

1340
01:29:45,548 --> 01:29:47,883
No one else gets off
that easy.

1341
01:29:50,686 --> 01:29:51,954
Turn around.

1342
01:29:59,595 --> 01:30:00,929
Get in your cell.

1343
01:30:05,734 --> 01:30:06,869
Hey, Phoenix.

1344
01:30:08,604 --> 01:30:10,639
Don't worry.
I'll be right next door.

1345
01:30:58,554 --> 01:31:01,456
O Lord,
make me brave...

1346
01:31:05,594 --> 01:31:08,296
brave enough to face the dark...

1347
01:31:18,106 --> 01:31:20,676
the dark that works
to pull me in.

1348
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,961
As the storm rages through...

1349
01:31:42,665 --> 01:31:46,001
let me rise above the gale
with bright eyes...

1350
01:31:56,044 --> 01:31:58,380
confident Thy way is wise.

1351
01:32:09,558 --> 01:32:11,493
Lord, make me brave...

1352
01:32:23,171 --> 01:32:26,541
brave enough to face the murk
of life.

1353
01:32:39,988 --> 01:32:42,357
Help me with my human plight.

1354
01:32:48,563 --> 01:32:50,699
Help me to retain my sight...

1355
01:33:02,510 --> 01:33:05,914
to know that from the dark
comes light.

1356
01:33:16,024 --> 01:33:17,626
To know that from the dark...

1357
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,695
comes light.

1358
01:33:34,442 --> 01:33:36,611
âª You know who I am âª

1359
01:33:36,745 --> 01:33:41,283
âª He said âª

1360
01:33:47,756 --> 01:33:53,862
âª The speaker was an angel âª

1361
01:33:54,462 --> 01:33:58,133
âª He coughed
And shook his crumpled wings âª

1362
01:33:58,266 --> 01:33:59,434
âª Closed his eyes âª

1363
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:05,240
âª And moved his lips âª

1364
01:34:06,174 --> 01:34:10,145
âª It's time we should be going âª

1365
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:17,152
âª Waiting so long âª

1366
01:34:17,285 --> 01:34:20,322
âª I've been waiting so long âª

1367
01:34:20,455 --> 01:34:24,727
âª I've been waiting so
Waiting so âª

1368
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:26,394
âª Waiting so âª

1369
01:34:26,528 --> 01:34:31,299
âª Look back in anger âª

1370
01:34:31,433 --> 01:34:35,170
âª Driven by the night âª

1371
01:34:35,437 --> 01:34:39,641
âª 'Til you come âª

1372
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:43,678
âª Waiting so long âª

1373
01:34:43,812 --> 01:34:47,182
âª I've been waiting so long âª

1374
01:34:47,315 --> 01:34:51,486
âª I've been waiting so
Waiting so âª

1375
01:34:51,619 --> 01:34:53,121
âª Waiting so âª

1376
01:34:53,255 --> 01:34:57,993
âª Look back in anger âª

1377
01:34:58,126 --> 01:35:02,030
âª See it in my eyes âª

1378
01:35:03,198 --> 01:35:08,570
âª 'Til you come âª

1379
01:35:54,783 --> 01:35:57,920
âª No one seemed to hear him âª

1380
01:35:58,053 --> 01:36:00,956
âª So he leafed
Through a magazine âª

1381
01:36:01,089 --> 01:36:04,426
âª And yawning
Rubbed the sleep away âª

1382
01:36:04,893 --> 01:36:08,263
âª Very sane, he seemed to me âª

1383
01:36:08,396 --> 01:36:10,498
âª Waiting so long âª

1384
01:36:10,632 --> 01:36:13,735
âª I've been waiting so long âª

1385
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:18,073
âª I've been waiting so
Waiting so âª

1386
01:36:18,206 --> 01:36:19,674
âª Waiting so âª

1387
01:36:19,808 --> 01:36:24,579
âª Look back in anger âª

1388
01:36:24,712 --> 01:36:28,083
âª Driven by the night âª

1389

âª 'Til you come âª

âª I've been waiting so

âª Feel it in my voice âª

01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:05,253
âª Waiting so, waiting so âª

1397
01:37:06,588 --> 01:37:10,959
âª Waiting so âª
