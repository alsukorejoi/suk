00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,750
The girls.

167
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:22,165
I can hear them every night.

168
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,916
Okay, we--
We're not available at the moment.

169
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,330
We're quite busy.
So I don't think we can. No, sorry.

170
00:13:29,416 --> 00:13:31,166
-I'm sorry.

Follow this simple technique.

-Find a quiet place with a mirror

174
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,833
where you will not be interrupted.
Look at yourself,

175
00:13:46,916 --> 00:13:49,286
-and focus.
-[ringing continues]

176

It's a gift. She has a gift.

177
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:02,633
She has a gift. She has a gift.

178
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,790
[woman]
Angela, do you see a future in psychology?

179
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:13,168
You've missed many assignments,
days of class.

180
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,540
Yeah, I haven't been
feeling very well recently.

181
00:14:24,375 --> 00:14:27,535
This is just a little extra money
on the side.

182
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,710
If you're not serious about this program,

183
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:32,921
another student
will gladly take your place.

184
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,170
No, I am, I've been dealing
with some family stuff. [sighs]

185
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,420
Have you considered
talking to somebody about it?

186
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,580
[man whispers] Angela.

187
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,043
It's nothing to be ashamed of,
we have excellent school counselors here,

188
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,705
-trained to help.
-I don't want to talk to anyone.

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:50,578
-[high-pitched whining]
-Well--

190
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:52,706
I can't pass you on good intentions.

191
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:57,380
Okay, is there something I can do,
any extra work I can do?

192
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,170
-[woman] How about this?
-[doorknob jostles]

193
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,420
For starters, show up.

194
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,250
You have potential. Embrace it.

195
00:15:05,916 --> 00:15:09,286
Don't be afraid
to really throw yourself into it.

196
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,791
You might surprise yourself.

197
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,331
-[man whispers] Angela.
-Angela.

198
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,500
Sorry, you have...

[man] Who are you?

202
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,633
Grandpa, you can't joke about that.

203
00:15:46,708 --> 00:15:47,578
[both chuckle]

204
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:50,036

Jokes are all I've got left, Angie-pie.

205
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,130
[softly] Hey Barney.

206
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:56,538
-How's Grandpa holding up?
-[jazz plays on radio]

207
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,205
Is he remembering to walk you?

208
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,420
[man] Hey, I heard that.

209
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,038
And I heard that.

210
00:16:06,541 --> 00:16:07,751
[softly] Is that a no?

211
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,631
[man] Oh, here.

212
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,706
[turns up the volume]

213
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:20,381
Your gran loved this song.

214
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:30,923
[whispers] So...

215
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,790
How's university?

216
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,290
[Angela] Hmm?

217
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,213
It's good.

218
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,501
It's okay.

219
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,333
[man] So why didn't you bring
any of those wee cakes

220
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,996
you bought the last time, eh?

221
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,881
She was always your favorite subject, eh?

222
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,670
Would you tell my grandson
he still owes me £500, from the last,

223
00:17:02,333 --> 00:17:05,213
get-rich-quick scheme he had?

224
00:17:05,833 --> 00:17:08,883
[man on tape]
Confidence is an armor against the world.

225
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,541
A confident man is a successful man.

226
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:16,381
Tame your mind and master your thoughts.

227
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:21,036
If you can control your mind,
you can influence others.

[Angela] What was she like?

00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,043
Before it all went...

235
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:01,001
Your mother...

236
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,246
pushed everyone away.

237
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,791
Drove your Gran mad, she was never here.

238
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,418
Went to America, never told anyone.
Started that...

00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:14,833
god-forsaken business.

240

Met your father.

I don't know what happened after that.

242
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,918
So she disappointed you?

It was a nonsense.

Locking herself away for... years.

247
00:18:55,125 --> 00:18:56,125
Talking about...

248
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,915
voices in her head.

249
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:06,325

Your mother was afraid.

If she had...

more strength...

255
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,208

No, we're available.

-What happened to your face?
-Don't worry about it.

What did you say to that old lady?

Old lady?

Jackson, seriously,
what are you messed up in?

266

She called back.
Said you turned her down.

[Angela] I just...

268
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:51,291
can't, it's too much.

269
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,210
Whatever happened to coming here
being a fresh start?

270
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,001
We're doing the same shit
we did back home.

271
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,003
-You agreed to it.
-[Angela] Because you made me.

272
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,583
And you said
it was going to be for a little while.

-When's it going to end?
-How do you think we've gotten by?

We don't have the equipment
to cover a place that big, anyway.

I've been calling El.
He'll have to gear up to sell it. Hey!

00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,963
We'll cheat it. She sounds ancient.
She won't know the difference.

Scary shit has happened
in that house, Jackson.

is put on a damn good show
and she sleeps better at night.

-That has nothing to with this.
-[Jackson] What's your issue?

288
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,328
She wants to pay us double our rate.
So she can move on.

It's a no-brainer.

I'm not a hustler like you and mom.

about how I dealt with it
or didn't deal with it.

Mom scratched her eyes out
because she couldn't handle reality.

This is our reality.

297

She left us shit.

298
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:11,326
All we got is grandpa who barely knows
what day of the week it is.

He knows how much you owe him.

300
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:17,631
I've been trying to make this work.

301
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,785
But you don't make it easy.

302
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:24,625
You think mom was some victim.
She wasn't. She left us, remember?

303
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:28,003
You better take control
of whatever's spiraling through

304
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,293
your little head right now.

305
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:33,075
Otherwise, you're gonna end up
a nutbag just like mom.

306
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:36,788
And we all know how that turned out.

307
00:22:38,166 --> 00:22:39,076

Going where?

318
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:15,418
Back to London. With or without you.

I swear.

Please, I pay off Craig
and then we're gone.

00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,420
[woman whispering] Angela...

327
00:24:22,916 --> 00:24:23,786
Beth?

328
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,923
[woman] I need you...

329
00:24:49,416 --> 00:24:50,326
Hello?

330
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,211
[woman] Angela...

331
00:25:07,166 --> 00:25:08,916
I can't find your brother.

332
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:16,036
Mom.

333
00:25:17,416 --> 00:25:18,246
Angela.

334
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:21,830
[gasping, panting]

335
00:25:34,166 --> 00:25:36,166
[footsteps approaching]

336
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,211
I'm in.

337
00:25:57,166 --> 00:25:58,246
Thank you, baby sis.

338
00:26:34,833 --> 00:26:36,833
[no audible dialogue]

339
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,788
This is it.

340
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,133
[Beth] This is it.

341
00:27:41,208 --> 00:27:42,208
What you looking at?

342
00:27:44,333 --> 00:27:46,213
That's where they found the girls' bodies.

343
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,246
-Where? In that building?
-Elliot, don't point.

344
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,331
[Beth] Her son left them all
sitting in a circle.

345
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,996
Propped up. Facing each other.

346
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:11,380
[Jackson] All right. Game faces.
Let's go say hi.

347
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:29,286
-[Mrs. Green] You must be Jackson.
I am indeed. Mrs. Green, pleasure to--

348
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,455
-[Mrs. Green] Who did that to you?
-Your gardener, he hit me with his locks.

349
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:36,041
-Handsome and funny.
-[chuckles]

350
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,713
[Mrs. Green] Victor's quite harmless.

351
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,245
Hello.

352
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:44,955
Angela.

353
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:49,205
This is Elliot, out technician.

354
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:53,381
And also Beth. Also very technical.

355
00:28:53,458 --> 00:28:54,328
Come in.

356
00:29:21,041 --> 00:29:22,421
You look very pretty.

357
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,830
Thank you.

358
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Go on. On the table.

359
00:29:28,875 --> 00:29:29,705
[Beth] Okay.

360
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,128
[Mrs. Green]
They're a wee bit under-baked.

361
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:35,038
That's how my girls liked them.

362
00:29:36,625 --> 00:29:37,785
Girls first.

363
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:40,375
Thank you.

364
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,040
[Jackson]
It's a great place, Mrs. Green.

365
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,330
Hmm.

366
00:29:46,375 --> 00:29:49,535
It was much easier to manage
when my husband was alive.

367
00:29:50,875 --> 00:29:54,245
Then we had a... housekeeper, cook.

368
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:58,165
-And a landscaper.
-Is it okay, actually,

369
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:02,830
sorry, if we get this part out of the way,
what we agreed to.

370
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,915
RECEIVED WITH THANKS

371
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,831
Well, yes. But...

372
00:30:09,333 --> 00:30:11,383
After the job's done, correct?

373
00:30:11,458 --> 00:30:16,708
I'm sorry. It's kind of awkward,
but, uh... it'd be great to just, sort it.

374
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:18,791
That's what you say on your flyer.

375
00:30:20,666 --> 00:30:22,126
Oh, you've got the flyer, right.

376
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,578
100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED

377
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:27,166
-Where'd you get that?
-You said you heard screaming?

378
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:31,043
Yes.

379
00:30:32,166 --> 00:30:33,126
Laughter...

380
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:37,003
to start with. And giggles.

381
00:30:37,666 --> 00:30:38,706
But then...

382
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:42,670
angry, taunting.

383
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,250
It's been 15 years

384
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,080
since we discovered what Herman...

385
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:58,381
Is it true that he murdered all the girls?

386
00:31:00,416 --> 00:31:03,496
That was a tragedy, Mrs. Green.

387
00:31:03,875 --> 00:31:04,825
Uh...

388
00:31:04,916 --> 00:31:07,126
And that's what we're here to help with.

389
00:31:07,458 --> 00:31:09,668
I wish I'd seen the signs earlier.

390
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:14,128
He was a curious child, my son.

391
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:15,668
I failed them.

392
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,786
I loved those girls.

393
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:20,463
[sighs]

394
00:31:20,541 --> 00:31:22,211
It wasn't your fault.

395
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:28,208
I just want a quiet house.

396
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:37,331
[Mrs. Green sighs]

397
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:43,331
Um...

398
00:31:43,666 --> 00:31:46,206
Okay, we'll need that one.
Yeah, just put into that...

399
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:49,671
[Angela] So, um... I was wondering
if you might have some photos.

400
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:52,540
-Photos?
-Of the girls, something I could use

401
00:31:52,625 --> 00:31:54,415
-to connect with them.
-I see.

402
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:58,380
It helps me address them directly.
Forms a better trust.

403
00:31:59,541 --> 00:32:01,461
[Mrs. Green] Here's us, all together.

404
00:32:09,916 --> 00:32:13,416
There's dear Missy. There.

405
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:16,131
And the tall one, Tammy.

406
00:32:17,541 --> 00:32:18,791
And that's sweet Claire.

407
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:21,881
She was such a sweet girl.

408
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,745
See the teddy.

409
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:26,878
Herman gave her that.

410
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:31,328
She was the first one to go missing.

411
00:32:37,416 --> 00:32:39,206
And that's...

412
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:47,128
[Mrs. Green] Herman. Yes, my son.

413
00:32:51,916 --> 00:32:54,166
The newspapers called him a monster.

414
00:32:54,458 --> 00:32:55,788
But he was my boy.

415
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,626
[man on tape]
Your mind is a powerful thing.

416
00:33:02,875 --> 00:33:05,245
-If you fill it with powerful thoughts...
-[Jackson] Fuck!

417
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:07,583
...your life will start to change.

418
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:11,625
You can't always control
what happens in life,

419
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:15,881
but you can always control
what happens in your mind.

420
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:21,575
If you can control your mind,
you can control your attitude

421
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,126
and how you handle a situation.

422
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:28,075
Then you can begin
to control the situation.

423
00:33:29,291 --> 00:33:31,751
Repeat your goal in your mind.

424
00:33:32,375 --> 00:33:33,625
Visualize it.

425
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,210
Make it happen.

426
00:33:36,458 --> 00:33:37,578
Be proactive.

427
00:33:37,958 --> 00:33:42,328
Take charge and remember
that you are amazing.

428
00:34:17,250 --> 00:34:19,790
[Jackson] Mrs. Green says skip
the East Hall due to repairs,

429
00:34:19,875 --> 00:34:20,995
so that helps us,

430
00:34:21,083 --> 00:34:23,673
but we'll need to pick
our staging areas carefully.

431
00:34:24,125 --> 00:34:27,915
Otherwise we'll wind up here till Friday
trying to make this feel legit. Got it?

432
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,130
[Beth] Okay. so let's just start
with the areas she's comfortable with

433
00:34:31,208 --> 00:34:33,958
-and take it from there.
-Yeah, I'll go hook the mikes up.

434
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:36,581
-Okay. You got those new voices, right?
-Yeah.

436

-[Beth] And wait for it.

437
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,830
[woman whispers] Mrs. Green.

438
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:44,956
[woman screams on tape]

439
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:49,041
Love it. All right, so, babe, I'll give
you a tap when it's time to cue Elliot.

440
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:52,075
We'll start with giggling
and then amp it up from there.

Why are you creeping up on me?

Can you hear me?

470
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:44,461
[Jackson] What happened? Did she fall?

471
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,501
I'm okay.

472
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:50,461
[El] She said she heard something,
and then, I don't know if she crashed out.

00:37:51,708 --> 00:37:54,998
Maybe-- Maybe we should just go, you know?
You know, come back--

Do you need anything?

-Yeah.

00:38:44,583 --> 00:38:45,583
Come on.

490
00:38:49,125 --> 00:38:51,745
[static crackles]

491
00:38:53,916 --> 00:38:56,246
[El]
Yeah, I'm all plugged in up here, so...

492
00:38:57,208 --> 00:39:00,628
Can I ask how
this is all going to work, exactly?

493
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:02,576
Yeah, sure.

494
00:39:05,041 --> 00:39:06,211
First,

495
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,420
Angela's going to sweep the house.

496
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:15,541
That might take some time but when
she establishes a connection and--

497
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:16,625
Jackson...

498
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:18,291
Uh-huh.

499
00:39:21,541 --> 00:39:24,921
Is this your usual routine
for all your clients?

500
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,290
[Beth] It's not up yet.

501
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,036
Stop the showmanship.

502
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,293
[El]
I'll check the wires you were after.

503
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,036
Sure.

504
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,921
Must be lovely
to be working with your sister.

505
00:39:48,625 --> 00:39:51,285
Family together. There's no greater joy.

506
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,130
What's happening?

507
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:59,173
We're waiting on them.

508
00:40:03,583 --> 00:40:04,583
You saw something.

509
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,248
What is it? What did you see?

510
00:40:14,583 --> 00:40:16,083
I'll believe you if you tell me.

511
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:21,705
Okay.

512
00:40:22,875 --> 00:40:25,625
The only reason...

513
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:31,378
I said I'd do this, I like my gadgets,
but when I found out...

514
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,956
you was doing it,
I thought it was pretty cool.

515
00:40:36,708 --> 00:40:39,248
I thought it was pretty cool
to hang out with you.

516
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:42,633
-Is it obvious?
-[chuckles]

517
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,708
-A little bit.
-Yeah.

518
00:40:45,875 --> 00:40:46,785
A big bit.

519
00:40:47,041 --> 00:40:48,421
-[Angela chuckles]
-Um...

[static]

521
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,333
[Beth] We're ready. All feeds are live.

522
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,125
Okay.

523
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:54,630
Ready?

524
00:40:56,375 --> 00:40:59,665
[Jackson] Are we filming something today
or not? Can't remember.

525
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,750
Uh, okay. Hold on.

526
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,876
[El] Three little donkeys
went up a tree,

527
00:41:11,583 --> 00:41:14,043
and none of them listened to me.

528
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,288
[Beth] Okay.

529
00:41:18,625 --> 00:41:20,165
Starting in the north hall.

[static]

531
00:41:32,333 --> 00:41:37,383
[Jackson] Ange will normally tell us
exactly the specifics of the voices

532
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:41,288
-and what she hears.
-Can you see from her face, huh?

533
00:41:41,958 --> 00:41:45,458
I can normally tell.
The girls, if they're talking to her.

534
00:41:45,541 --> 00:41:47,881
They'll be able to tell her
where they are,

535
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,208
they'll lead Ange to them.

536
00:41:50,291 --> 00:41:53,081
-[Mrs. Green] Uh-huh.
-And when they've made the connection,

537
00:41:53,166 --> 00:41:58,786
they'll be able to discuss further
what action will be taken.

538
00:41:58,875 --> 00:42:01,035
-So that they can leave the house.
-Uh-huh.

539
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,500
-One by one?
-One by one.

540
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,833
That's how she does it.
She'll make contact with each of them

541
00:42:09,916 --> 00:42:13,666
and ask them one by one to leave.

542

[Angela] Claire.

Tammy.

00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,380
My name is Angela Sayers.

546
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,916
Mrs. Green has called me here.

547
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,206
I've come to see
if you'd consider leaving this house.

[El] What?

551
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:56,631
I'll check these out.

553
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:25,083
[Angela] Something's here.

554

[Jackson] Elliot, where's she going?

[Angela] Tammy.

559

You really don't see her?

560
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,538
[El] I can't see anything.

561
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:20,828
She wants us to follow her.

562
00:45:22,541 --> 00:45:23,671
[El] Okay.

563
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,040
[Mrs. Green] Where are they going?

564
00:45:28,708 --> 00:45:30,578
[Jackson] Ange, can you sense a presence?

565
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,630
Are they going to the East Wing?

566
00:45:33,500 --> 00:45:35,290
[Jackson] Can we stick to the plan, guys?

567
00:45:53,458 --> 00:45:55,498

Jackson, he's not answering.

582
00:46:55,041 --> 00:46:56,791
I think he's hurt bad. Okay, Elliot...

-We should go help.
-No.

00:47:25,458 --> 00:47:26,288
Are you okay?

Elliot?

592
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,211
[El] It's my ankle.
I heard something pop.

593
00:47:32,291 --> 00:47:33,921
Shit! It hurts!

-El, you alive, man?
-[El] Yes.

608
00:48:13,875 --> 00:48:16,535
I think I'm going to need
to go to hospital though.

609
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:19,000
[Jackson] We'll get you outtta there.
Just hold tight.

610
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,213
Did you call for help?

611
00:48:21,125 --> 00:48:24,575
We're going to have to carry him up,
all right. We'll just keep going.

612
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:27,503
-We need to finish this job.
-Jackson.

613
00:48:29,583 --> 00:48:31,503
If we call an ambulance here...

-We're screwed.
-Dammit, Jackson. It's Elliot.

615
00:48:35,208 --> 00:48:36,208
[Beth] Is El okay?

616
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,500
Can you ask Mrs. Green
if we can find a ladder?

617
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:44,416
Okay.

618
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,791
And maybe a rope.

619
00:48:56,041 --> 00:48:59,501
-What, you don't trust me?
-The maple tree behind East Hills?

620
00:48:59,875 --> 00:49:00,995
I was 12.

621
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,583
Yeah, well, my knee
still clicks weird when I walk.

622
00:49:04,958 --> 00:49:07,418
-This is great. I love working with you.
-[scoffs]

623
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,130
Hold it.

-[El grunts]
-It's okay. It's okay.

-[El groaning]
-Ew. That's fucked.

[Angela] Jackson...

632
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,750
HELP

633
00:49:58,875 --> 00:50:00,455
The girls were kept down here.

634
00:50:26,416 --> 00:50:27,826
Jesus Christ.

635
00:50:38,083 --> 00:50:39,173
Look at the mouth.

636
00:50:39,916 --> 00:50:41,326
She wanted us to find it.

637
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,791
[Jackson] Who?

638
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:44,828
Tammy.

639
00:50:46,166 --> 00:50:48,956
And Tammy is...

640
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:51,246
Okay...

641
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:53,785
I know this sounds nuts.

642
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:58,333
But ever since our last gig,
I have been...

643
00:50:58,833 --> 00:51:00,463
-seeing things.
-[sighs]

644
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:02,041
Jackson, I'm not joking.

645
00:51:02,875 --> 00:51:04,245
[El] She might be right.

646
00:51:05,333 --> 00:51:08,423
It could even be Herman's ghost,
running around here,

647
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,710
-trying to kill us all off for revenge.
-I saw those girls.

648
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,380
And their mouths are sewn up,
just like the story said.

649
00:51:15,458 --> 00:51:17,378
Ange, it's just a house.

650
00:51:18,166 --> 00:51:21,576
We're in a basement
and someone was doodling on the wall.

651
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:24,631
-That's all there is to it.
-She led us right here.

652
00:51:25,375 --> 00:51:27,375
It's no coincidence
that we ended up down here.

653
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:29,078
[El] I don't think it's a coincidence.

654
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:32,286
I don't think any of this
is a coincidence. Us being in here,

655
00:51:32,375 --> 00:51:34,875
in life, in general,
none of it is a coincidence.

656
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:36,458
Good talk. Let's get up.

657
00:51:41,375 --> 00:51:43,665
[scoffs, groans]

658
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,960
[Jackson] Hey, buddy.
Drop the camera, will you?

659
00:51:46,750 --> 00:51:49,080
-El, drop the camera.
-[El] Jackson.

660
00:51:49,875 --> 00:51:53,995
[breathes heavily]
This is my responsibility.

661
00:51:54,791 --> 00:51:56,381
[groans]

662
00:52:03,458 --> 00:52:04,958
[El panting]

663
00:52:05,041 --> 00:52:06,171
[Jackson] Okay.

664
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,080
All right.

665
00:52:11,041 --> 00:52:12,331
Let's finish the job.

666
00:52:12,625 --> 00:52:15,705
Fuck you, Jackson,
and fuck this scamming shit.

667
00:52:15,791 --> 00:52:16,671
I'm done.

668
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:19,535
You've got a serious attitude problem.

669
00:52:20,041 --> 00:52:21,331
[Angela] I know what I saw.

670
00:52:21,625 --> 00:52:22,625
[Jackson chuckles]

671
00:52:24,041 --> 00:52:25,711
You've fucking lost it, Ange.

672
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,041
Quit the jokes, Jackson.

673
00:52:30,541 --> 00:52:31,541
[Jackson chuckles]

674
00:52:32,916 --> 00:52:35,206
[Jackson]
You actually believe in this shit now?

675
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,710
[Angela] Believe in it?
This was all your idea.

676
00:52:39,583 --> 00:52:42,293
[Jackson] If you just stuck to the script
instead of wandering off

677
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:43,625
like a crazy person...

678
00:52:44,041 --> 00:52:47,421
[Angela] I'm not crazy.
The girls are real, this is real.

679
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,500
[girl, whispering]
Are you being our friend?

680
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,793
[Angela] Jackson,
they're trying to tell us something.

681
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:54,081
-[girl] Angela.
-[Jackson] You sound just like Mom.

682
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:55,996
[Ange]
Well, maybe Mom wasn't crazy either.

683
00:52:56,083 --> 00:52:58,083
[girl] Jackson.

684
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:05,458
[door creaks open]

685
00:53:10,541 --> 00:53:11,541
[door slams]

686
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,038
[sighs]

687
00:53:24,458 --> 00:53:29,418
Hey. Mrs. Green,
we're just having a slight hiccup.

688
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,750
Nothing to worry about. Uh...

689
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,003
Hey.

690
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:46,040
We're going to cleanse this house.

691
00:53:46,458 --> 00:53:47,418
I promise you.

692
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:51,381
I'm afraid you have failed.

693
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,880
Mrs. Green, I assure you
we'll be able to get the voices out.

694
00:53:58,666 --> 00:53:59,786
You have my word.

695
00:54:00,958 --> 00:54:02,878
-No way--
-Be quiet.

696
00:54:05,541 --> 00:54:07,581
I really thought you could help me.

697
00:54:08,791 --> 00:54:10,131
It's not real, is it?

698
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,921
Any of it. It's all an act.

699
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,381
Angela's gift.

700
00:54:18,750 --> 00:54:22,290
I thought if you could hear the voices too
you'd be able to stop them.

701
00:54:27,041 --> 00:54:30,081
I want you out of here immediately.

702
00:54:32,625 --> 00:54:33,705
[Jackson] It is real.

703
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:35,920
Everything.

704
00:54:37,250 --> 00:54:38,420
Everything.

705
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:42,708
But you can't control the unseen, okay?

706
00:54:47,708 --> 00:54:50,168
[Mrs. Green]
I wanted to give them a happy future.

707
00:54:50,958 --> 00:54:52,668
I tried to give them everything.

708
00:54:54,291 --> 00:54:56,501
So that maybe they'd thank me later,

709
00:54:57,375 --> 00:54:59,035
and think of me as their mother.

710
00:55:00,083 --> 00:55:01,713
But they wouldn't listen to me.

711
00:55:02,208 --> 00:55:03,788
They would not be quiet.

712
00:55:04,583 --> 00:55:06,833
Herman was a sweet boy.

713
00:55:08,708 --> 00:55:11,248
The girls were to blame, not him.

714
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:14,581
Those little monsters...

715
00:55:20,750 --> 00:55:23,580
Beth, pack up. We're getting
the fuck out of here.

716
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,375
[El breathes deeply]

717
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
It's like...

718
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:35,500
I don't even think you're a freak.

719
00:55:35,875 --> 00:55:39,535
And I know that everyone at uni

720
00:55:40,166 --> 00:55:42,036
obviously thinks you're a bit weird.

721
00:55:43,375 --> 00:55:45,915
That's kind of something
I always liked about you.

722
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,500
You know...

723
00:55:51,083 --> 00:55:52,713
[Jackson] Ange, pick up.

724
00:55:55,541 --> 00:55:56,381
Jackson.

725
00:55:57,750 --> 00:55:59,460
I'm coming to get you and Elliot.

726
00:56:00,583 --> 00:56:02,173
Beth, we're leaving.

727
00:56:02,416 --> 00:56:03,956
[girl] Angela...

728
00:56:14,916 --> 00:56:16,246
[girl] Angela.

729
00:56:32,416 --> 00:56:33,376
Beth?

730
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:42,250

732
00:57:37,291 --> 00:57:38,291
[Tammy] Jackson.

733
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
[panting continues]

734
00:57:50,916 --> 00:57:52,166
[Angela] Jackson!

735
00:57:54,666 --> 00:57:56,666
Jackson, get down here now.

736
00:58:01,333 --> 00:58:02,963
[Jackson] Beth, meet us at the car.

737
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:05,043
Beth?

738
00:58:05,125 --> 00:58:07,245
-[El] No, no, stop!
-[Jackson] Beth, can you hear me?

739
00:58:07,333 --> 00:58:08,423
Meet us at the car!

740
00:58:08,583 --> 00:58:10,583
[El groaning]

741
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:13,670
[Jackson] Get up, now.

742
00:58:14,375 --> 00:58:15,375
[Angela] Elliot.

743
00:58:16,416 --> 00:58:17,416
Come on.

00:58:19,458 --> 00:58:21,458
-Come on.
-No.

00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,583
Beth?

747
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:27,253
Beth?

748
00:58:29,125 --> 00:58:30,375
Beth, where are you?

749
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:34,455
Beth, can you hear me?

750
00:58:41,958 --> 00:58:43,498
Ange, what are you doing?

751
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:51,995
Is that...?

752
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:03,745
Beth.

753
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:05,996
[both gasp]

754
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:16,875
Did you see her?

755
00:59:22,416 --> 00:59:23,576
Beth, where are you?

756
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,376
I need to follow her.

757
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,495
Take Elliot and meet us at the car.

758
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,325
I love you. I'm sorry.

759
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:38,210
But we're supposed to stick together.
Jackson!

We're gonna get you up. It's okay.

Who did this to her?

01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,583
El, come on.

821

Hey, where's Jackson?

[El coughs]

824
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:05,463
[El] He took him.

825

[Angela] Who took him?

826
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:09,500
Elliott. Who?

827

Oh, dear. We have woken you.

We do apologize
about your pretty little girlfriend.

You see...

832
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:52,288
I could not risk having
the wolves at my door.

833
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:56,325
Not again.

834

[girl giggling]

837
01:09:28,750 --> 01:09:30,670
My mother taught me well.

838
01:09:32,875 --> 01:09:34,575
She'd use the belt on me.

839
01:09:36,833 --> 01:09:38,833
Garden sheers.

840
01:09:41,083 --> 01:09:42,883
She'd burn my privates.

841
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,750
If those girls had just listened.

842

This part is very tricky.

Hold still.

Shh!

Whispering around the house.

862

I told them.

863
01:11:49,791 --> 01:11:52,081
Every family has secrets.

864
01:11:55,083 --> 01:11:56,583
But after little Claire...

865
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,251
they had to be silenced.

866
01:12:03,625 --> 01:12:04,625
Hush, now.

867
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:09,291
There. All over.

868
01:12:13,250 --> 01:12:14,750
Now go and get the others.

I'm so sorry I couldn't help you.

Herman, take him to the shed.

After you've dealt with him,
bring back the other boy.

No, no.

Jackson, no, no! No!
