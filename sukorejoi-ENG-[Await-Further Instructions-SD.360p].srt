2
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,388
Well... we're here.

3
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,126
Can we not do this?

4
00:01:44,858 --> 00:01:46,858
I want to meet them.

5
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,431
We will spoil
everyone's Christmas.

6
00:01:50,264 --> 00:01:51,900
Come on!

7
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,541
Nick!

8
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:04,980
It's so good to see you.

9
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:08,180
Mum, this Annjaya, Annji.

10
00:02:08,182 --> 00:02:10,216
- Annjeera?
- Annji.

11
00:02:10,218 --> 00:02:13,120
Oh... yes that's lovely.

12
00:02:13,122 --> 00:02:15,826
Well, come on in,
you must be freezing.

13
00:02:20,529 --> 00:02:22,229
We got you this,
Mrs. Milgram?

14
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:23,230
Indian sweets.

15
00:02:23,232 --> 00:02:25,866
Those are Petha cubes,
pumpkin pieces in syrup,

16
00:02:25,868 --> 00:02:28,235
Gulab Jamun dumplings,
all sorts.

17
00:02:28,237 --> 00:02:30,037
Well, that's lovely.

18
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,342
Thank you.
Thanks.

19
00:02:33,976 --> 00:02:37,011
Oh here,
have a hankie.

20
00:02:37,013 --> 00:02:38,212
Thanks.

21
00:02:38,214 --> 00:02:40,015
You keep it.

22
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:41,483
Dad around?

23
00:02:41,485 --> 00:02:42,950
We should say hi.

24
00:02:42,952 --> 00:02:44,955
Oh, let him come down
in his own time.

25
00:02:46,056 --> 00:02:47,155
Well, go through.

26
00:02:47,157 --> 00:02:48,257
Granddad's is in front
of the telly.

27
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,092
Kate and her Scott
will be here soon.

28
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:53,061
Full house this year.
You are staying?

29
00:02:53,063 --> 00:02:54,528
Please say you will?

30
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,467
- Um...
- We'd love to.

31
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,571
Now you may
remember from yesterday

32
00:03:02,573 --> 00:03:04,539
that we were getting
some isolated reports

33
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,575
of powers surges
from areas in the midlands

34
00:03:06,577 --> 00:03:08,478
and north west
of the country.

35
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,612
Those reports seem
to be increasing

36
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,581
- and are now coming in from other areas
- Annji.

37
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,217
of the country as well.

38
00:03:14,219 --> 00:03:15,784
Let us take a look
at some of the pictures

39
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:18,189
- that people have been sending in...
- Merry Christmas, Gramps.

40
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,456
Hi, Mister Milgram.

41
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:22,425
I'm Annji.
Nick's girlfriend.

42
00:03:22,427 --> 00:03:23,930
Merry Christmas.

43
00:03:24,196 --> 00:03:25,931
Uh...

44
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:30,870
So how are we all
getting along?

45
00:03:31,304 --> 00:03:33,073
Um...

46
00:03:42,648 --> 00:03:44,415
Well,

47
00:03:44,417 --> 00:03:46,617
I have to say,
I didn't know you were coming.

48
00:03:46,619 --> 00:03:48,219
Oh, it wasn't definite.
I mean...

49
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,255
Don't have a pop at Mum,
Dad.

50
00:03:50,257 --> 00:03:52,524
You know at work
it is staff policy

51
00:03:52,526 --> 00:03:55,093
to put personal
arrangements in writing

52
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:57,227
about a month in advance.

53
00:03:57,229 --> 00:03:59,633
Well, it really was
a last minute thing.

54
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,633
Besides, our mobiles
are conked out, so...

55
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:05,305
So, your phone wasn't
working all last year then?

56
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,374
Or the last three years,
in fact?

57
00:04:09,376 --> 00:04:12,110
They're here now.
That's what counts.

58
00:04:12,112 --> 00:04:14,479
Ah, very well... good.

59
00:04:14,481 --> 00:04:16,147
It's my fault, Mr Milgram.

60
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,384
I was on emergency
cover shifts this week.

61
00:04:18,386 --> 00:04:20,118
I'm Annji.
Nick's girlfriend.

62
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,586
Very pleased
to meet you, Angela.

63
00:04:21,588 --> 00:04:23,622
I'll get started
on the tea.

64
00:04:23,624 --> 00:04:25,394
I'll let Mum
know we're here.

65
00:04:32,632 --> 00:04:34,201
Hello?

66
00:04:34,502 --> 00:04:36,135
Hello, Mum?

67
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,136
Hello?

68
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:40,176
Shit.

69
00:04:46,382 --> 00:04:49,215
With diplomatic efforts
now seemingly completely stalled

70
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:51,350
with regards to the crisis
on the peninsula.

71
00:04:51,352 --> 00:04:53,020
How much do you think
the actions

72
00:04:53,022 --> 00:04:54,755
of these Russian
pilots and the...

73
00:04:54,757 --> 00:04:58,392
♪ Oh come all ye faithful...

74
00:04:58,394 --> 00:05:00,264
You kept all the decorations.

75
00:05:01,097 --> 00:05:03,534
Yes well, they're not broken,
why replace them?

76
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:10,071
They bring back
good memories.

77
00:05:10,073 --> 00:05:11,542
Dad.

78
00:05:14,576 --> 00:05:17,545
Do you remember that
Christmas with the power cuts?

79
00:05:17,547 --> 00:05:20,150
We decorated the tree
by candlelight.

80
00:05:21,718 --> 00:05:24,589
You picked me and Kate up
so we could hang the baubles.

81
00:05:27,591 --> 00:05:29,258
Well, maybe this year
we can have

82
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,764
a proper family Christmas
like we used to, yeah?

83
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:38,570
I better go see
if Mum needs me.

84
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:48,480
It's nice he likes
his fairy lights.

85
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:55,085
Funny, I was in the military
police for thirty years

86
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:57,256
and look how
you've turned out.

87
00:05:58,155 --> 00:06:02,627
You're a clerk and your
son's a deadbeat pansy.

88
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:07,629
Mind, a few good slaps
sorts that out,

89
00:06:07,631 --> 00:06:10,235
doesn't it, eh, Squelcher?

90
00:06:12,437 --> 00:06:15,608
I said, a few good slaps...

91
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:18,645
I'm an Office Manager...

92
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,212
I'm an Office Manager.

93
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:27,487
Smells good, Mum.

94
00:06:30,622 --> 00:06:33,060
Oi!
You'll spoil your dinner.

95
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,765
Merry Christmas!

96
00:06:41,767 --> 00:06:44,669
Oh, everyone's here.
I am so happy!

97
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:46,274
Aw, Mum!

98
00:06:47,274 --> 00:06:49,773
Oh, Gramps,
love you.

99
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,777
Smile for the camera.
Give us good gums Gramp!

100
00:06:52,779 --> 00:06:54,682
Oh, hey.

101
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:57,452
Hey, Sis,
long time no see.

102
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,485
Oh, you're not far off?

103
00:07:00,487 --> 00:07:02,420
Annji, did you meet Scott?

104
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,690
You'll have lots to talk about.
He's in medicine, too.

105
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:05,791
Oh cool, where?

106
00:07:05,793 --> 00:07:06,858
Freeman Hospital.

107
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,827
You?

108
00:07:07,829 --> 00:07:09,762
Saint Mark's Ambulance
Service.

109
00:07:09,764 --> 00:07:11,163
Kate's due in a week.

110
00:07:11,165 --> 00:07:12,230
Two weeks.

111
00:07:12,232 --> 00:07:14,233
But you're okay?
No back pain?

112
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:15,300
Gushing? Hand swells?

113
00:07:15,302 --> 00:07:18,704
No, but I'm in an utter
flap about the holidays.

114
00:07:18,706 --> 00:07:20,605
I mean, you hear all
these stories on the news

115
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:22,511
about foreign cover doctors...

116
00:07:27,815 --> 00:07:29,683
I'm so sorry.

117
00:07:29,685 --> 00:07:31,184
It's fine.

118
00:07:31,186 --> 00:07:33,953
No, I don't want
you to think...

119
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:34,688
It's fine.

120
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,659
Who wants tea?
Alfred? Nick?

121
00:07:53,742 --> 00:07:56,244
Six letters, Tumult.

122
00:07:56,246 --> 00:07:57,847
That's not a real word!

123
00:07:58,847 --> 00:08:00,215
It really is.

124
00:08:01,718 --> 00:08:03,684
Indian words don't count.

125
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:04,985
It's English.

126
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,391
Shall I get the dictionary...
again?

127
00:08:09,225 --> 00:08:11,461
Don't be silly.
It's just a bit of fun.

128
00:08:13,663 --> 00:08:15,267
Have a Gulab Jamun.

129
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,202
That's our shopping precinct!

130
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:20,571
Oh my gosh!

131
00:08:24,341 --> 00:08:25,541
...this afternoon.

132
00:08:25,543 --> 00:08:27,743
It's now been confirmed
that one person has died

133
00:08:27,745 --> 00:08:30,779
and a further two remain in
hospital with serious injuries

134
00:08:30,781 --> 00:08:33,548
after a stabbing incident
just off the main high street

135
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,753
the police are saying could be
a suspected terrorist incident.

136
00:08:37,755 --> 00:08:40,390
We're now also getting reports
that a man has been arrested...

137
00:08:40,392 --> 00:08:43,525
Well, ain't no surprise to me.

138
00:08:43,527 --> 00:08:44,327
Really?

139
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:47,731
I read,
I know what's going on.

140
00:08:47,733 --> 00:08:48,897
Alfred, please.

141
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,767
Letting anyone come
flooding in.

142
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:53,703
Was always going
to end like this.

143
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,371
Gramps,
you can't say that.

144
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:56,939
Everyone's entitled
to their own opinions,

145
00:08:56,941 --> 00:08:57,875
but still.

146
00:08:57,877 --> 00:09:00,277
Mr Milgram,
I know we've only just met

147
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:01,445
and I don't know much
about your life,

148
00:09:01,447 --> 00:09:03,381
but that's not fair.

149
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:04,515
You're right,

150
00:09:04,517 --> 00:09:06,349
you don't know anything
about Gramps!

151
00:09:06,351 --> 00:09:08,419
Kate, please, let's not
blow it out of proportion.

152
00:09:08,421 --> 00:09:09,653
Gramps is being out of order.

153
00:09:09,655 --> 00:09:13,491
This country used to be great,
till all them Johnny Ahmed's

154
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:16,730
and Bobby Bongo Bongos
started coming in.

155
00:09:17,764 --> 00:09:19,763
All I'm trying to say is that
if we let these things go,

156
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,666
then we're perpetuating
those views.

157
00:09:21,668 --> 00:09:23,734
How patronizing.

158
00:09:23,736 --> 00:09:24,936
Who do you think you are?

159
00:09:24,938 --> 00:09:27,372
Kate, you can't fucking
seriously be siding with Gramps?

160
00:09:27,374 --> 00:09:29,041
Please don't swear, love.

161
00:09:29,043 --> 00:09:30,575
You come into our home...

162
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:31,375
Kate, I'm warning you.

163
00:09:31,377 --> 00:09:32,944
Don't you shout
at my girlfriend.

164
00:09:32,946 --> 00:09:34,845
You come here
with your tumults

165
00:09:34,847 --> 00:09:36,947
and your bloody pumpkins
in syrup...

166
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,617
Kate, shut the fuck up!

167
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,250
Hey!

168
00:09:39,252 --> 00:09:41,288
Alright, that is enough!

169
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,258
You'll apologize.

170
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:44,922
Me apologize?

171
00:09:44,924 --> 00:09:45,891
Now!

172
00:09:55,436 --> 00:09:58,837
I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

173
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:00,441
Mum...

174
00:10:07,716 --> 00:10:09,318
It's not you.

175
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,454
It's not.

176
00:10:12,954 --> 00:10:14,056
It's...

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:17,026
Well, it's not you.

178
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:20,461
Annji,
treasure, please,

179
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:22,599
they didn't mean
anything by it.

180
00:10:22,964 --> 00:10:24,566
Mum, this was a mistake.

181
00:10:25,434 --> 00:10:27,904
You won't go?
Please don't.

182
00:10:30,605 --> 00:10:32,740
Come visit us in the
New Year on your own

183
00:10:32,742 --> 00:10:34,544
or something.

184
00:10:47,023 --> 00:10:48,723
Shit, Annj.

185
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:50,594
I never thought it would
kick off like that.

186
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,630
I don't want to stay.

187
00:10:55,999 --> 00:10:59,471
Look, here's what we do,

188
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:04,440
tomorrow we'll get up
really early before they do

189
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,108
and we will just go home,

190
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,643
and we'll order
a turkey pizza

191
00:11:08,645 --> 00:11:10,615
and watch Christmas Dr Who.

192
00:11:11,048 --> 00:11:12,614
Yeah?

193
00:11:12,616 --> 00:11:16,118
Now, I'd better get back
to my room as you know,

194
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,820
two people outside
of Christian wedlock

195
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:19,825
should not share a bedroom.

196
00:13:20,149 --> 00:13:22,818
You better drive.
My head feels fuzzy.

197
00:13:23,754 --> 00:13:25,490
Yeah, mine too actually.

198
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:28,792
Whoa...

199
00:13:29,626 --> 00:13:31,160
What is that?

200
00:13:35,031 --> 00:13:36,733
I think it's metal?

201
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:40,905
The surface is so weird.

202
00:13:46,043 --> 00:13:49,180
Looks like it's been fitted
on purpose... kids?

203
00:13:49,881 --> 00:13:51,783
Then what's that?

204
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:11,937
Nick?

205
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:15,137
I was having a nightmare.

206
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:16,875
There was this
awful banging.

207
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:49,073
Is there anything
to get this thing off?

208
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:50,945
Tools? Crowbar?

209
00:14:54,147 --> 00:14:56,016
There's an axe
in the garage.

210
00:15:00,221 --> 00:15:01,690
Mind out.

211
00:15:04,424 --> 00:15:05,690
Stop! Stop!

212
00:15:05,692 --> 00:15:07,227
Please,
the neighbors will hear.

213
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:11,830
Let's get your dad,
he'll know what to do.

214
00:15:11,832 --> 00:15:13,101
Hello?

215
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,669
Hello?

216
00:15:16,236 --> 00:15:17,969
Can anyone hear us?

217
00:15:17,971 --> 00:15:20,040
Help! Help!

218
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:25,879
What in the hell
is all this racket?

219
00:15:25,881 --> 00:15:27,379
Someone's locked us in.

220
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,050
What are you on about?

221
00:15:30,718 --> 00:15:32,655
They're all the same.

222
00:15:43,064 --> 00:15:45,065
Well this is nonsense.

223
00:15:45,067 --> 00:15:46,869
Nonsense.

224
00:15:47,068 --> 00:15:49,705
Am I the only one here
with any sense whatsoever?

225
00:16:16,432 --> 00:16:18,299
It won't budge, Dad.

226
00:16:18,301 --> 00:16:20,367
Oh, this can't be happening.

227
00:16:20,369 --> 00:16:22,306
I'm giving birth
in two weeks.

228
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:25,940
It's got to be a natural
disaster or something.

229
00:16:25,942 --> 00:16:28,011
But who would lock us in?

230
00:16:28,344 --> 00:16:30,178
Could it be
a reality show?

231
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,179
Some sort of awful game?

232
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:35,318
That's it!
That's got to be it.

233
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,954
It's too insane
to be really real.

234
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,856
We could be on camera
right now!

235
00:16:39,858 --> 00:16:41,326
No, it's the authorities.

236
00:16:42,226 --> 00:16:43,959
- You think?
- Well obviously.

237
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:48,930
There's been an incident
and we've been quarantined

238
00:16:48,932 --> 00:16:52,968
until they regain control
of the situation.

239
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,203
I suppose.

240
00:16:54,205 --> 00:16:56,037
Well, you said it yourself,
didn't you.

241
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,207
I mean, these shutters
are all metal.

242
00:16:58,209 --> 00:17:00,146
They surround
the entire house.

243
00:17:02,081 --> 00:17:04,046
Only the government could
manage something like that.

244
00:17:04,048 --> 00:17:06,083
It still doesn't explain
the pipes.

245
00:17:06,085 --> 00:17:08,285
They poke into every room.

246
00:17:08,287 --> 00:17:10,487
Well, they could be there
to vent in clean oxygen,

247
00:17:10,489 --> 00:17:11,488
couldn't they?

248
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,226
Well, it's possible,
isn't it?

249
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,228
You know, there really are
some ingenious people

250
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,497
and sensible people working
in the government these days,

251
00:17:20,499 --> 00:17:21,968
so believe me.

252
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:24,969
So from now on we keep
all the windows open,

253
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:27,372
let the vents do there job,
lets let the air in.

254
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:28,943
Scott, if you can help me.

255
00:17:29,909 --> 00:17:31,375
I'm calling the Police.

256
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:33,114
I'll check the News.

257
00:17:35,415 --> 00:17:37,384
You all better come see this.

258
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:45,192
It's overriding every channel.

259
00:17:48,329 --> 00:17:49,865
Well, what does it mean?

260
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:53,132
It has to be the emergency
government broadcast.

261
00:17:53,134 --> 00:17:55,401
In the aftermath of 7/7

262
00:17:55,403 --> 00:17:58,404
we learnt that the
authorities reserved

263
00:17:58,406 --> 00:18:01,039
an emergency frequency

264
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,473
that would come into play
in the event

265
00:18:02,475 --> 00:18:04,879
that the networks
were knocked out.

266
00:18:05,146 --> 00:18:07,046
It's a nuke, isn't it!

267
00:18:07,048 --> 00:18:10,382
I saw it on the TV.
It's the EMU pulse.

268
00:18:10,384 --> 00:18:13,118
Electromagnetic pulse.
E. M. P.

269
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,891
Oh, you think
you're so clever.

270
00:18:17,492 --> 00:18:18,290
I don't think it can be.

271
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:19,392
All the electrics
would be fried.

272
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:21,126
The TV would be dead.

273
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:22,428
And our phones
are still working,

274
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:23,930
there's just no network.

275
00:18:23,932 --> 00:18:25,331
Well, why have all the
clocks stopped working

276
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,902
at the same time, then?

277
00:18:28,403 --> 00:18:31,340
I... can't answer that.

278
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:34,074
I still can't work out

279
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,913
how we all managed
to sleep through it?

280
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:41,884
Look, we haven't even
checked online yet.

281
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,331
That's the fifth try.
Nothing.

282
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,900
Dead.

283
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,337
No internet.

284
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,141
Landlines dead.

285
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:39,545
No communication
outside of this house.

286
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,357
Scott?

287
00:19:55,494 --> 00:19:57,230
Yeah?

288
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,566
Can I count on you, Scott?

289
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:07,103
Uh yeah.
Sure, Tone.

290
00:20:07,105 --> 00:20:08,237
No worries.

291
00:20:08,239 --> 00:20:10,978
You see I need to know
you'll back me.

292
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,081
We need to be shepherds.

293
00:20:16,216 --> 00:20:20,187
Protect the herd,
even from themselves.

294
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:24,389
We're men, Scott,
and sometimes we're called upon

295
00:20:24,391 --> 00:20:26,694
to do things
that no one else will.

296
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,395
I say to my team at work,

297
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:34,434
be your best
on your worst day.

298
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:37,673
Okay?

299
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:41,409
- Yeah, Tone, sure.
- Good.

300
00:20:54,388 --> 00:20:55,423
Careful.

301
00:21:04,732 --> 00:21:08,437
Okay, so we need
to puzzle this out.

302
00:21:08,804 --> 00:21:09,902
Well, the message
clearly shows

303
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:12,605
that the authorities
have the attack under control.

304
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:16,578
So, we sit tight.
Await for rescue.

305
00:21:17,212 --> 00:21:18,044
Right.

306
00:21:18,046 --> 00:21:20,646
No one said anything
about an attack.

307
00:21:20,648 --> 00:21:23,084
It's Christmas Day.

308
00:21:23,086 --> 00:21:25,720
It's the perfect
time to strike.

309
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:29,289
The day of the year when our
defenses are at their lowest.

310
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:32,195
Lot's of them don't even
celebrate Christmas.

311
00:21:32,628 --> 00:21:34,598
If it's an attack.

312
00:21:40,302 --> 00:21:42,303
- It's alright, love.
- Careful. Careful.

313
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,574
It's okay.

314
00:21:44,206 --> 00:21:46,476
It will be okay.

315
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,146
Right, we need to wait
for more instructions,

316
00:21:52,148 --> 00:21:53,481
but in the meantime,

317
00:21:53,483 --> 00:21:56,551
we are going to celebrate
this special day

318
00:21:56,553 --> 00:21:58,455
as we would any other year.

319
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,557
If we don't uphold our values

320
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,425
and have a proper
British Christmas

321
00:22:04,427 --> 00:22:06,095
the terrorists
have already won.

322
00:22:06,097 --> 00:22:07,499
Here. Here.

323
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:40,566
Dear Lord...

324
00:22:44,603 --> 00:22:46,603
Dear Lord, for what
we are about to receive

325
00:22:46,605 --> 00:22:48,672
let us be truly thankful.

326
00:22:48,674 --> 00:22:50,508
We thank you for our health

327
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:53,644
and the presence of our family
in this trying time.

328
00:22:53,646 --> 00:22:55,879
We do not try to guess
your grand design,

329
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:58,281
but rather look to the
example set by your son

330
00:22:58,283 --> 00:22:59,754
who was born on this day.

331
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,722
He knew his duty.

332
00:23:04,757 --> 00:23:07,794
With your Grace we shall
preserve and we shall prevail.

333
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:09,394
Amen.

334
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:14,666
What's wrong with her now?

335
00:23:14,668 --> 00:23:16,368
I've got a cold starting.

336
00:23:16,370 --> 00:23:18,438
Annji's got a touch of flu,
Gramps.

337
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:21,206
She got you wrapped
around her pinky.

338
00:23:21,208 --> 00:23:22,774
Your cunt struck
good and proper.

339
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:23,775
- Alfred, please!
- Dad!

340
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,477
That was fucking bang
out of order, Gramps!

341
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,412
- Apologize now!
- Nah.

342
00:23:27,414 --> 00:23:29,681
Maybe Annji picked up
something by accident?

343
00:23:29,683 --> 00:23:31,716
We don't know
what's going on out there.

344
00:23:31,718 --> 00:23:34,754
Could be an infection
like sarin or...

345
00:23:34,756 --> 00:23:36,688
Sarin's a nerve gas,
not an infection.

346
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:38,491
Or, or plutonium then.

347
00:23:38,493 --> 00:23:40,560
Also, not an infection.

348
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:41,860
I know that!
I'm not stupid!

349
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:43,562
Look, let's just eat.

350
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:45,667
We'll think a lot clearer
with some food inside us.

351
00:23:46,301 --> 00:23:47,434
This is a farce.

352
00:23:47,436 --> 00:23:48,401
The world could be ending

353
00:23:48,403 --> 00:23:50,336
and we're shoveling
sprouts into our faces.

354
00:23:50,338 --> 00:23:53,207
Oh, I bet it'd be different
if it was one of your holidays.

355
00:23:53,209 --> 00:23:54,675
Can everyone
please stop shouting.

356
00:23:54,677 --> 00:23:55,709
Look, come on,

357
00:23:55,711 --> 00:23:57,710
Mum's spent ages on this,
it looks delicious.

358
00:23:57,712 --> 00:23:59,446
If I'm infected,
then you are, too.

359
00:23:59,448 --> 00:24:01,314
You and laughing boy
arrived after we did...

360
00:24:01,316 --> 00:24:02,849
Can you not have
a go at us.

361
00:24:02,851 --> 00:24:05,485
We're a family and this woman
is carrying my baby, okay.

362
00:24:05,487 --> 00:24:07,321
So, I've had enough,
no more.

363
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:08,854
Don't trust her!

364
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,591
When I was stationed
in the Middle East

365
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:11,860
they had tricks to fool you.

366
00:24:11,862 --> 00:24:13,894
Gramps, you don't know what
you're talking about, do you?

367
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:17,433
- You just carry on...
- Be quiet!

368
00:24:21,403 --> 00:24:23,273
Please.

369
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:26,343
Now,

370
00:24:26,942 --> 00:24:28,875
I'm about to carve
the turkey.

371
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:30,480
Ooh.

372
00:24:30,713 --> 00:24:32,383
Look!

373
00:24:41,025 --> 00:24:42,658
Well, there is nothing
to discuss,

374
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:47,395
because I refuse to entertain
your clever notions

375
00:24:47,397 --> 00:24:49,767
that could put this family's
health at risk.

376
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:52,604
Dad.

377
00:24:53,804 --> 00:24:55,437
You are useless.

378
00:24:55,439 --> 00:24:58,442
Sitting there like a lump
while my dad takes charge.

379
00:25:00,645 --> 00:25:02,045
What can I do?

380
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:04,780
You're always telling
everyone what a man you are.

381
00:25:04,782 --> 00:25:07,319
Here's your chance.
Prove it.

382
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,423
Protect your family.

383
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,855
End of.

384
00:25:12,857 --> 00:25:14,993
Dad, it's our food.

385
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:19,229
Oh, so now you know better

386
00:25:19,231 --> 00:25:22,031
than disaster management team,
do you?

387
00:25:22,033 --> 00:25:24,934
All I'm saying is,
lets take a step back,

388
00:25:24,936 --> 00:25:26,806
and take stock
for a second...

389
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:30,277
What are you doing?

390
00:25:30,909 --> 00:25:32,478
You know.

391
00:25:34,047 --> 00:25:36,446
Alright, but how long
might this last?

392
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:38,615
The TV said
nothing about water

393
00:25:38,617 --> 00:25:40,887
and you can live
for weeks without food.

394
00:25:41,954 --> 00:25:43,320
When I raised money
for Comic Relief

395
00:25:43,322 --> 00:25:45,789
I ate nothing but energy
bars for a month.

396
00:25:45,791 --> 00:25:47,895
The organizers were amazed.

397
00:25:48,494 --> 00:25:50,061
We've got a pregnant woman...

398
00:25:50,063 --> 00:25:51,896
Don't use me as an excuse!

399
00:25:51,898 --> 00:25:54,768
I'm strong.
I'm a team player.

400
00:25:56,436 --> 00:25:57,636
We won't be able
to risk the tap water,

401
00:25:57,638 --> 00:26:00,539
but I did instruct your mother
to get some bottled water

402
00:26:00,541 --> 00:26:03,908
in for the holidays,
so we'll ration that.

403
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,743
Well, I hope that lasts
long enough.

404
00:26:05,745 --> 00:26:07,678
- Oh, we'll cope.
- Yeah.

405
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,683
That's it, walk away.

406
00:26:23,732 --> 00:26:26,031
Don't you ever
undermine me

407
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,833
in front of the others again.

408
00:26:27,835 --> 00:26:30,672
You are no longer
the head of this family.

409
00:26:32,407 --> 00:26:34,139
Alright,

410
00:26:34,141 --> 00:26:36,542
but it's not so easy
when there's no head office

411
00:26:36,544 --> 00:26:39,349
to check in with,
is it, Squelcher?

412
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:45,455
Act decisively,
with iron authority.

413
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,488
Take him,

414
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,926
he won't obey you when
it really matters, you know.

415
00:26:52,895 --> 00:26:55,495
If you'd been harder
on him as a lad

416
00:26:55,497 --> 00:26:58,868
he wouldn't have grown up
to thumb his cock at authority.

417
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:04,041
Didn't do you any harm,
did it, Squelcher?

418
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:06,643
It's changed again.

419
00:27:10,147 --> 00:27:12,781
"Decontaminate yourselves.

420
00:27:12,783 --> 00:27:15,886
Strip and scrub all flesh
with household bleach."

421
00:27:16,952 --> 00:27:19,656
Beth,
get the cleaning products.

422
00:27:27,998 --> 00:27:30,434
Do we really think
it's an infection?

423
00:27:31,701 --> 00:27:33,535
We don't know
what's outside.

424
00:27:33,537 --> 00:27:35,504
We should probably go through
with it, just in case.

425
00:27:41,778 --> 00:27:43,781
That really is minging.

426
00:27:44,515 --> 00:27:45,480
See?

427
00:27:47,585 --> 00:27:51,121
Although, I did actually
bring some decorations

428
00:27:51,123 --> 00:27:54,660
from downstairs up here.

429
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,014
I don't understand
why we're doing this.

430
00:28:17,016 --> 00:28:18,815
Well, because
there is a chance

431
00:28:18,817 --> 00:28:20,017
that some of the
poisonous dust

432
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,952
might have settled
on our bodies,

433
00:28:21,954 --> 00:28:23,220
in our hair.

434
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,789
We may have walked it
into the house.

435
00:28:25,791 --> 00:28:27,528
It could be on our clothes.

436
00:28:30,963 --> 00:28:33,533
Do you remember
when we were first married,

437
00:28:34,568 --> 00:28:37,038
how we used to take
baths together?

438
00:28:41,275 --> 00:28:43,011
What are you doing?

439
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:46,447
This isn't a game, Beth.
It's life or death.

440
00:28:48,816 --> 00:28:52,116
Right, so, I suggest we start
with our armpits and crotch,

441
00:28:52,118 --> 00:28:53,855
and go from there.

442
00:29:02,664 --> 00:29:04,967
It could be terrorism
though, couldn't it?

443
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:08,867
Yeah,

444
00:29:08,869 --> 00:29:12,207
and if it is,
we'll get through it together.

445
00:29:13,742 --> 00:29:15,511
We're a team.

446
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,137
You okay in there, Dad?

447
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:45,809
I can still scrub
my own balls!

448
00:29:46,175 --> 00:29:48,178
I'll be down the hall
if you need me.

449
00:29:57,788 --> 00:30:00,091
Will you come
downstairs, please.

450
00:30:06,062 --> 00:30:09,731
Your mother has
persuaded me that...

451
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:13,205
sometimes I'm too hard
on other people

452
00:30:14,237 --> 00:30:16,938
because of the high standard
I set myself.

453
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,610
Ha!

454
00:30:19,377 --> 00:30:23,378
Well okay, we've all been
under a lot of pressure so,

455
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,147
I'm sorry, too.

456
00:30:25,149 --> 00:30:27,218
Well, I didn't say
I was sorry.

457
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,387
Everything I have done
has been to help this family.

458
00:30:31,389 --> 00:30:33,591
Okay, then I apologize.

459
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,764
I'm sorry, too.

460
00:30:41,766 --> 00:30:43,201
I was nervous about
meeting you...

461
00:30:46,304 --> 00:30:47,704
Annj, no.

462
00:30:47,706 --> 00:30:49,708
No, leave that for me,
please.

463
00:31:02,054 --> 00:31:03,958
Hypodermics.

464
00:31:09,228 --> 00:31:12,865
Okay, who is going
to do it then?

465
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:19,974
It's not sealed.

466
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,709
These have been used already.

467
00:31:24,711 --> 00:31:25,843
No.

468
00:31:25,845 --> 00:31:27,345
It is for our own good.

469
00:31:27,347 --> 00:31:29,047
It really isn't.

470
00:31:29,049 --> 00:31:31,885
Lets just talk
about this sensibly.

471
00:31:32,119 --> 00:31:33,451
It's an order.

472
00:31:33,453 --> 00:31:35,454
It's a fucking teletext page.

473
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:36,721
Do you know how dangerous

474
00:31:36,723 --> 00:31:39,027
unsterilized medical
equipment is?

475
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:58,013
Dad.

476
00:32:23,439 --> 00:32:25,142
I'm fine.

477
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:27,411
Who's next?

478
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:36,286
Okay, they're sterilized.

479
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,046
Come here.

480
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:35,114
Cowards.

481
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:41,887
Dad, be careful.

482
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:58,438
Mum, please don't.

483
00:34:03,577 --> 00:34:06,513
Beth, we're just trying
to keep everyone safe.

484
00:34:33,306 --> 00:34:34,476
Come on, babe.

485
00:34:35,276 --> 00:34:37,179
Your turn,
you can do it.

486
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:41,581
The baby...
I can't risk the baby.

487
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:43,483
You've got to do it.

488
00:34:43,485 --> 00:34:46,385
Don't say that!
Don't tell me what to do!

489
00:34:46,387 --> 00:34:48,390
Come on,
you saw the message.

490
00:34:49,023 --> 00:34:51,193
It's the only way we can
make sure everyone's safe.

491
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:53,963
No, no.

492
00:34:55,162 --> 00:34:57,333
Dad, please don't
make me choose.

493
00:34:58,033 --> 00:34:59,065
I can't.

494
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,469
Kate, don't listen to them.

495
00:35:02,471 --> 00:35:04,404
We could risk losing
both of you.

496
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:06,040
Be quiet.

497
00:35:06,042 --> 00:35:07,475
You heard what Annji said

498
00:35:07,477 --> 00:35:09,076
and she's the only one
with any medical training.

499
00:35:09,078 --> 00:35:11,312
We don't know what's in
those syringes, do we?

500
00:35:11,314 --> 00:35:13,080
I'm warning you.

501
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:14,248
All of you!

502
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:15,516
Y-you're pulling at me like

503
00:35:15,518 --> 00:35:17,984
dogs fighting
over a pork chop!

504
00:35:17,986 --> 00:35:18,986
I can't breath!

505
00:35:18,988 --> 00:35:21,225
Just...
let me think.

506
00:35:40,644 --> 00:35:42,080
Good girl.

507
00:35:53,325 --> 00:35:55,194
Two left.

508
00:36:09,274 --> 00:36:10,644
Annj,

509
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,481
we don't have a choice.

510
00:36:40,606 --> 00:36:43,243
Good, now we're safe.

511
00:36:47,546 --> 00:36:48,949
Dad?

512
00:36:53,553 --> 00:36:54,955
Dad?

513
00:37:07,402 --> 00:37:09,704
Oh, no!

514
00:37:19,579 --> 00:37:21,049
Dad?

515
00:37:22,316 --> 00:37:23,552
Dad?

516
00:37:41,836 --> 00:37:43,472
I told you!

517
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,407
I told you!

518
00:37:46,409 --> 00:37:48,743
It doesn't make any sense.
It doesn't...

519
00:37:48,745 --> 00:37:50,777
It doesn't make any sense.

520
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:52,813
W-what about the rest of us?

521
00:37:52,815 --> 00:37:54,581
I mean,
that stuff is in Kate

522
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:56,550
and my baby!

523
00:37:56,552 --> 00:37:59,119
You told us it would be okay!
You promised!

524
00:37:59,121 --> 00:38:01,725
He was an old man
and old men die.

525
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:04,759
Are you trying to say
this was a coincidence?

526
00:38:04,761 --> 00:38:08,628
Well, maybe the same thing
would have happened to us,

527
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,631
if we hadn't taken it.

528
00:38:10,633 --> 00:38:13,102
It just didn't work on him.

529
00:38:13,104 --> 00:38:15,303
Maybe it was
an allergic reaction?

530
00:38:15,305 --> 00:38:17,305
You've got
to be kidding me.

531
00:38:17,307 --> 00:38:19,177
No, but it's possible,
isn't it?

532
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:25,115
He died because the
medicine didn't work?

533
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:29,684
I will not have my,

534
00:38:29,686 --> 00:38:32,423
my father's sacrifice
undermined.

535
00:38:34,426 --> 00:38:38,594
Now we all took the shot
and only Dad was affected.

536
00:38:38,596 --> 00:38:40,230
We don't know why

537
00:38:40,232 --> 00:38:42,400
and that's all
we know right now.

538
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:48,373
If we hadn't taken the drug,
we might all have died.

539
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,410
So this, this, this is...

540
00:38:53,678 --> 00:38:56,248
well, it is
an acceptable loss.

541
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,689
What slot?

542
00:39:07,459 --> 00:39:09,425
Right Scott, go upstairs

543
00:39:09,427 --> 00:39:12,428
and get some sheets
to cover the body,

544
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:14,767
and collect up
all the syringes.

545
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,846
We can't carry on like this
with your dad in charge.

546
00:39:27,547 --> 00:39:29,584
We have to find a way out.

547
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:32,753
There must be something
we've missed.

548
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,202
It's everywhere.

549
00:40:31,747 --> 00:40:32,714
Help!

550
00:40:32,915 --> 00:40:34,615
Help us please!

551
00:40:34,617 --> 00:40:36,453
Help! Help!

552
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,521
Argh!

553
00:40:41,424 --> 00:40:43,259
Ah!

554
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:53,303
I just can't understand
how it's happened.

555
00:40:56,672 --> 00:40:58,809
Take another swig, babe.

556
00:41:00,343 --> 00:41:01,944
It'll be okay.
It'll be okay.

557
00:41:01,946 --> 00:41:04,783
It'll be okay...
Oh God, oh God, oh...

558
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:39,551
What an end to Boxing Day.

559
00:41:45,825 --> 00:41:47,593
Bye, Gramps.

560
00:41:49,896 --> 00:41:51,765
Squelcher.

561
00:41:53,099 --> 00:41:54,568
What?

562
00:41:56,369 --> 00:41:58,405
Squelcher.

563
00:42:00,707 --> 00:42:03,807
You called me Squelcher.

564
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:05,709
Why?

565
00:42:05,711 --> 00:42:07,713
"Because you wet the bed."

566
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:11,885
Just once,
when I was little.

567
00:42:12,986 --> 00:42:14,786
Why?

568
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:17,989
Because I was scared.

569
00:42:17,991 --> 00:42:20,726
I was scared of waking you,

570
00:42:20,728 --> 00:42:23,698
by flushing the chain
after curfew.

571
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,600
You heard me crying

572
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:31,339
and you let me
lay there all night.

573
00:42:33,473 --> 00:42:36,577
And in the morning,
you battered me blue.

574
00:42:42,584 --> 00:42:44,887
"Real men can hold it."

575
00:42:49,057 --> 00:42:54,626
You see, I live with
the understanding

576
00:42:54,628 --> 00:42:57,800
that there's a greater
purpose than myself.

577
00:43:01,102 --> 00:43:03,872
Everything happens
for a reason,

578
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:06,910
even this.

579
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:09,813
Dad.

580
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:13,450
You have no idea
what it's like to be a father.

581
00:43:16,051 --> 00:43:19,819
Always trying to choose
the right path.

582
00:43:19,821 --> 00:43:22,425
Always worried
about your children.

583
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,931
Even when they vanish
for years without a calling.

584
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:34,372
He knew.

585
00:43:35,806 --> 00:43:37,974
I know.

586
00:43:43,079 --> 00:43:45,082
You don't know.

587
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,702
Whose next?

588
00:44:04,135 --> 00:44:06,571
Squelcher.

589
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:09,741
The baby...

590
00:44:10,808 --> 00:44:12,911
I can't risk with the baby.

591
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:27,724
Come downstairs.

592
00:44:27,726 --> 00:44:29,494
There's something
we need to discuss.

593
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:38,202
It doesn't say
who is infected.

594
00:44:38,204 --> 00:44:39,504
So how do we know?

595
00:44:39,506 --> 00:44:41,772
It doesn't have to.
It's obvious.

596
00:44:41,774 --> 00:44:42,540
It's a cold.

597
00:44:42,542 --> 00:44:44,140
She had it
before she came here

598
00:44:44,142 --> 00:44:45,942
and she's got a name, Kate!

599
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,111
Calm down, Nick.

600
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:48,912
This isn't a fight
we can win.

601
00:44:48,914 --> 00:44:49,881
Well, you said it.

602
00:44:49,883 --> 00:44:51,848
Kate, if you weren't
my sister, I swear...

603
00:44:51,850 --> 00:44:54,986
Oi, don't even think it.

604
00:44:54,988 --> 00:44:57,724
You are risking
everyone's life.

605
00:44:58,592 --> 00:44:59,992
Angela clearly
contracted something

606
00:44:59,994 --> 00:45:01,860
on her emergency shift.

607
00:45:01,862 --> 00:45:04,295
Who thinks Annji's the
one we should quarantine?

608
00:45:04,297 --> 00:45:06,734
Don't do it.
Don't you dare.

609
00:45:10,938 --> 00:45:12,840
Mum, say something, please.

610
00:45:13,907 --> 00:45:15,944
Mum. Mum!

611
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,011
The majority has spoken.

612
00:45:19,013 --> 00:45:20,913
- Scott, get her.
- Put her upstairs.

613
00:45:20,915 --> 00:45:22,247
Nick, no!

614
00:45:34,329 --> 00:45:36,097
Get off him!

615
00:45:37,164 --> 00:45:39,298
Ding dong,
merrily on high

616
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,068
In heaven the bells
are ringing

617
00:45:42,070 --> 00:45:44,169
Ding dong,
verily the sky

618
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:47,040
Is riv'n
with angel singing

619
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:49,879
Gloria...

620
00:45:52,647 --> 00:45:54,848
Shush... shush, shush.

621
00:45:54,850 --> 00:45:58,587
- Hosanna in excelsis.
- It's okay, Beth.

622
00:46:00,855 --> 00:46:02,956
You can't lock her in there
with Granddad's body!

623
00:46:02,958 --> 00:46:04,290
We hung up a sheet round it.

624
00:46:04,292 --> 00:46:06,659
Oh, like a plague ward?

625
00:46:06,661 --> 00:46:08,929
We have our instructions.

626
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:10,932
Isolate the dead.

627
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,303
The infected.

628
00:46:13,336 --> 00:46:14,702
No.

629
00:46:14,704 --> 00:46:17,104
Nick!
It's okay.

630
00:46:17,106 --> 00:46:19,543
I've been around
dead people before.

631
00:46:20,043 --> 00:46:21,711
Please.

632
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:42,801
Annj, you okay?

633
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,137
I love you.

634
00:46:47,038 --> 00:46:48,971
Do you believe those
pipes are to feed us air

635
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,772
like your dad says?

636
00:46:50,774 --> 00:46:51,843
No.

637
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:54,279
Me neither.

638
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,780
I don't think the messages
are a government broadcast.

639
00:46:57,782 --> 00:47:00,684
It's almost like they're
reacting to what we do.

640
00:47:00,686 --> 00:47:02,718
That's a bit of a leap, Annj.

641
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,590
Think about
the timing though.

642
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:07,224
Every time
we overcome a problem

643
00:47:07,226 --> 00:47:08,959
it comes back
with something worse.

644
00:47:08,961 --> 00:47:10,363
Exactly.

645
00:47:10,896 --> 00:47:13,733
It's like there's someone
watching through the TV.

646
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:17,733
I think you should try
switching it off and on.

647
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:19,202
Just to see what happens.

648
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:20,970
No.
No, I could never do that.

649
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:22,707
That TV is Dad's
life line now.

650
00:47:22,709 --> 00:47:24,645
You have to try, Nick.

651
00:47:25,745 --> 00:47:28,015
I know you can
stand up to him.

652
00:47:29,716 --> 00:47:31,015
Annji, what if
I to turn it off

653
00:47:31,017 --> 00:47:32,685
and it just stays on?

654
00:48:06,387 --> 00:48:08,019
Uh...
You okay?

655
00:48:08,021 --> 00:48:09,023
Yeah.

656
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,290
What you doing?

657
00:48:11,292 --> 00:48:12,859
Well, I need to pee.

658
00:48:12,861 --> 00:48:14,330
I always need to pee.

659
00:48:18,466 --> 00:48:20,366
Ah!

660
00:48:20,368 --> 00:48:22,435
Oh God.
You're not? Is this...

661
00:48:22,437 --> 00:48:25,841
Baby just doing the Tango.

662
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:30,046
Could I?

663
00:48:30,778 --> 00:48:32,013
I mean...

664
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:42,858
Oh, I felt it.

665
00:48:43,759 --> 00:48:45,061
It's amazing.

666
00:48:46,929 --> 00:48:48,395
Anyway, I better...

667
00:48:48,397 --> 00:48:50,400
Don't want to gush
everywhere.

668
00:49:10,387 --> 00:49:12,356
You're not the boss of me.

669
00:49:22,033 --> 00:49:24,203
Ah!
What are you doing?

670
00:49:24,469 --> 00:49:26,502
It's nothing, Kate.
I am just testing a theory.

671
00:49:26,504 --> 00:49:29,070
Don't you patronize me,
you prick.

672
00:49:29,072 --> 00:49:30,940
It's been the same
since we were kids.

673
00:49:30,942 --> 00:49:32,842
You think you're so clever.

674
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:34,277
You think you can do
anything you want.

675
00:49:34,279 --> 00:49:35,545
You're not better
than we are.

676
00:49:35,547 --> 00:49:37,246
- Kate...
- Dad'll put you in your place!

677
00:49:37,248 --> 00:49:38,980
- Just you wait and see...
- No, no, no, Kate.

678
00:49:38,982 --> 00:49:41,819
Dad!
Nick's broke the telly!

679
00:49:46,959 --> 00:49:47,858
What have you done?

680
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,160
I'm just testing
something out, Dad.

681
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:51,898
What have you done?!

682
00:49:53,999 --> 00:49:55,999
Come on, come on,
come on, come on...

683
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:57,137
No.

684
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,541
Come on!

685
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:20,592
Oh, you couldn't leave
it alone, could you?

686
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:22,226
You always have to be right!

687
00:50:22,228 --> 00:50:23,895
Calm down!
Nothing happened!

688
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:25,964
Me and my baby could suffer
penalties because of you!

689
00:50:25,966 --> 00:50:27,498
- Stop!
- Don't touch her!

690
00:50:36,978 --> 00:50:38,079
Go on! Get him!

691
00:50:40,914 --> 00:50:42,449
Get him, Scott!

692
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,889
Ah!

693
00:50:51,258 --> 00:50:52,894
Kate!

694
00:51:05,107 --> 00:51:06,640
Do something!
Help her!

695
00:51:06,642 --> 00:51:07,940
You have to do something!

696
00:51:07,942 --> 00:51:09,341
Stop shrieking, woman.
Let me think!

697
00:51:09,343 --> 00:51:10,310
How did this happen?

698
00:51:10,312 --> 00:51:12,145
We need to let Annji out!
She's a medic!

699
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:13,379
Annji's infected!
I won't risk it!

700
00:51:13,381 --> 00:51:15,181
- But Kate might die, Dad!
- No!

701
00:51:15,183 --> 00:51:17,216
Scott, you work
in a hospital...

702
00:51:17,218 --> 00:51:18,585
Scott, do you know
what you're doing?

703
00:51:18,587 --> 00:51:20,089
You need to help us!

704
00:51:20,288 --> 00:51:21,588
Scott,
she's your fucking wife!

705
00:51:21,590 --> 00:51:23,192
Help her!

706
00:51:51,155 --> 00:51:52,220
Watch her head.

707
00:51:52,222 --> 00:51:53,654
Easy. Easy.

708
00:51:53,656 --> 00:51:55,056
Scott?

709
00:51:55,058 --> 00:51:55,924
Scott, stop that!

710
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:58,960
Come on, come on
you need to help her!

711
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:00,397
Hold her hand.

712
00:52:01,665 --> 00:52:02,663
It's alright.

713
00:52:02,665 --> 00:52:04,633
Mum, we need um,
water to clean the wounds.

714
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:06,634
We need uh,
something to wrap it,

715
00:52:06,636 --> 00:52:08,069
you make her comfortable.

716
00:52:08,071 --> 00:52:09,539
Easy, come on.
Easy!

717
00:52:09,541 --> 00:52:10,539
Scott!

718
00:52:10,541 --> 00:52:12,240
Painkillers. Painkillers,
strong as we have.

719
00:52:12,242 --> 00:52:13,074
Come on!

720
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:14,610
T-There's whiskey!
There's whiskey!

721
00:52:14,612 --> 00:52:18,047
No alcohol, no pills!
My baby!

722
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:20,016
Okay, one second,
I need one of those.

723
00:52:20,018 --> 00:52:21,384
Come here.

724
00:52:21,386 --> 00:52:23,286
Is-is she...?

725
00:52:23,288 --> 00:52:24,387
She's passed out.

726
00:52:24,389 --> 00:52:25,322
Now with a wound like this,

727
00:52:25,324 --> 00:52:26,489
she will slip in and out
of consciousness.

728
00:52:26,491 --> 00:52:29,726
- Will the baby be alright?
- I have no fucking idea.

729
00:52:29,728 --> 00:52:32,027
- Will you please stop...
- Please don't swear, I know,

730
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,231
but Mum, I don't know.
I'm sorry.

731
00:52:34,233 --> 00:52:36,734
Alright, I'm going to work
in the study.

732
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,401
I don't want to be disturbed.

733
00:52:38,403 --> 00:52:39,202
What?

734
00:52:39,204 --> 00:52:40,571
Well, it's too noisy
down here,

735
00:52:40,573 --> 00:52:42,439
and you might be right.

736
00:52:42,441 --> 00:52:44,408
I think we need
a different approach.

737
00:52:44,410 --> 00:52:45,575
A new plan.

738
00:52:45,577 --> 00:52:47,611
Dad, you can't go,
it's Kate!

739
00:52:47,613 --> 00:52:49,212
Dad?!

740
00:52:49,214 --> 00:52:50,381
Fucking coward!

741
00:52:50,383 --> 00:52:53,417
Okay... um, easy, easy.

742
00:52:53,419 --> 00:52:55,551
We need some water
or something, Mum.

743
00:52:55,553 --> 00:52:57,491
Scott, come on!
Come on!

744
00:53:06,165 --> 00:53:09,369
Shush, shush, shush, hey!

745
00:53:13,572 --> 00:53:14,773
Oh, this is ridiculous.

746
00:53:14,775 --> 00:53:16,641
She's my child!

747
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:18,379
Your sister.

748
00:53:19,379 --> 00:53:21,749
Um... hello.

749
00:53:23,785 --> 00:53:26,419
If you can hear me,
I'm Beth.

750
00:53:26,421 --> 00:53:27,753
Beth Milgram.

751
00:53:27,755 --> 00:53:33,091
I'm with my family
at 25 Stanford Street.

752
00:53:33,093 --> 00:53:36,729
We-we know you're busy but
we've had an awful accident.

753
00:53:36,731 --> 00:53:41,200
My daughter Kate,
she's broken her leg.

754
00:53:41,202 --> 00:53:45,672
It's when, when the bone...
Nick?

755
00:53:45,674 --> 00:53:49,509
- It's a compound fracture.
- It's a compound fracture.

756
00:53:49,511 --> 00:53:52,478
You sent the syringes.
Please help us again!

757
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:56,215
She's my daughter Kate.

758
00:53:56,217 --> 00:53:58,217
She's pregnant.

759
00:53:58,219 --> 00:54:01,591
We love her.
I'm begging you...

760
00:54:03,257 --> 00:54:05,424
Please help.

761
00:54:08,397 --> 00:54:12,436
The um, the skin's tight
and there's...

762
00:54:14,503 --> 00:54:16,369
red streaks in the, uh,

763
00:54:16,371 --> 00:54:20,240
the-the veins that,

764
00:54:20,242 --> 00:54:21,441
the veins that are
coming away

765
00:54:21,443 --> 00:54:23,346
from the wound are dark.

766
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,050
Nick, the wounds infected.

767
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,120
Sounds like sepsis
has set in.

768
00:54:32,421 --> 00:54:34,422
If we don't get Kate
medical attention soon,

769
00:54:34,424 --> 00:54:35,794
she'll die.

770
00:54:37,828 --> 00:54:39,631
What about the baby?

771
00:54:42,533 --> 00:54:44,299
No.

772
00:54:44,301 --> 00:54:47,236
- Mum, please...
- No. I don't believe that.

773
00:54:47,238 --> 00:54:48,737
I won't.
I can't believe that.

774
00:54:48,739 --> 00:54:51,276
I can't, I can't, I can't.

775
00:54:52,375 --> 00:54:55,145
We'll talk about this later.
I've got a lot of work to do.

776
00:54:56,147 --> 00:54:58,882
- Mum, look I...
- No. I've got to get busy.

777
00:54:58,884 --> 00:55:00,816
Mo and the boys
are coming tomorrow

778
00:55:00,818 --> 00:55:03,288
and the place is such a tip.

779
00:55:08,159 --> 00:55:09,828
That's not going to happen,
Mum?

780
00:55:15,833 --> 00:55:17,333
Merry Christmas!

781
00:55:17,335 --> 00:55:20,570
Aw, everyone's here!
I'm so happy.

782
00:55:20,572 --> 00:55:24,810
Aw, Mum.
Aw, Gramps, love you!

783
00:55:28,513 --> 00:55:32,118
We um,
we picked out names.

784
00:55:33,319 --> 00:55:36,456
We had Lewis
if it was a boy

785
00:55:37,423 --> 00:55:41,595
and we had Ruby
if it was a girl.

786
00:55:42,328 --> 00:55:45,362
Scott, the only way
Kate will recover

787
00:55:45,364 --> 00:55:47,465
is if we get help.

788
00:55:47,467 --> 00:55:49,367
We have to escape.

789
00:55:49,369 --> 00:55:52,707
We must follow the leader.

790
00:55:53,507 --> 00:55:55,710
Be shepherds for the flock.

791
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,213
Our "leader"
has locked himself away.

792
00:56:01,347 --> 00:56:02,849
We can't rely on him.

793
00:56:03,483 --> 00:56:06,351
Scott, we have
to stop fighting

794
00:56:06,353 --> 00:56:08,255
and work together.

795
00:56:11,758 --> 00:56:16,395
There was, um,
there was something else...

796
00:56:16,397 --> 00:56:19,497
when-when Kate got hurt
and she was screaming.

797
00:56:19,499 --> 00:56:22,937
I-I thought it was my mind
playing tricks on me, but um...

798
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:31,245
the-the message changed
when I was staring right at it.

799
00:56:32,947 --> 00:56:34,616
What did it say?

800
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,489
"I see you."

801
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:48,931
Dad?

802
00:56:52,368 --> 00:56:53,703
Dad!

803
00:58:09,681 --> 00:58:13,719
Kate... myself and Annji.

804
00:58:17,857 --> 00:58:19,593
Annji?

805
00:59:59,896 --> 01:00:01,029
Scott, come with me.

806
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:02,566
No.

807
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,102
You didn't help Kate.

808
01:00:06,736 --> 01:00:09,407
You locked yourself away
and you hid from us.

809
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:12,574
I'm Kate's father,

810
01:00:12,576 --> 01:00:15,177
and don't you think I've
been spending every second

811
01:00:15,179 --> 01:00:16,848
trying to find a way
to help her?

812
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,418
Scott,

813
01:00:21,719 --> 01:00:23,822
be your best
on your worst day.

814
01:00:24,589 --> 01:00:25,857
Come on.

815
01:00:58,156 --> 01:00:59,992
Dad, you've got
to see this.

816
01:01:00,192 --> 01:01:01,461
Right.

817
01:01:02,228 --> 01:01:03,130
Dad?

818
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:04,764
Dad!

819
01:01:07,534 --> 01:01:08,132
Stay calm.

820
01:01:13,038 --> 01:01:14,507
Scott.

821
01:01:21,081 --> 01:01:23,017
Nick! Nick!

822
01:01:24,017 --> 01:01:25,720
Are you okay?

823
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:29,657
What now?

824
01:01:32,059 --> 01:01:33,827
Um, well,

825
01:01:34,994 --> 01:01:37,564
go and see what
the television says now.

826
01:01:39,666 --> 01:01:41,068
Dad, please.

827
01:01:41,702 --> 01:01:42,600
Look at the phone.

828
01:01:42,602 --> 01:01:44,303
There's something
going on out there.

829
01:01:44,305 --> 01:01:45,138
Be quiet.

830
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:47,040
You've caused enough
trouble already.

831
01:01:47,042 --> 01:01:48,777
That was an accident.

832
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:52,515
But I...
I can't explain it.

833
01:01:54,015 --> 01:01:57,116
It's not natural.
The house is surrounded by...

834
01:01:57,118 --> 01:01:59,288
snakes or something.
I don't know.

835
01:02:00,821 --> 01:02:02,590
What is it?

836
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,592
What?
You think I'm a bumpkin?

837
01:02:06,594 --> 01:02:07,196
Is that it?

838
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:09,632
No, Dad.

839
01:02:13,869 --> 01:02:15,604
Dad...

840
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:17,271
Dad. Da...

841
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:37,962
Well?

842
01:02:38,395 --> 01:02:40,230
Any new orders?

843
01:03:36,689 --> 01:03:38,321
Dad, this is insane!

844
01:03:38,323 --> 01:03:41,194
We have to stop
listening to the TV.

845
01:03:42,694 --> 01:03:43,627
Dad?

846
01:03:43,629 --> 01:03:46,299
Well, um, we'll start
at the beginning.

847
01:03:48,835 --> 01:03:50,904
- Who sent you?
- No one.

848
01:03:52,938 --> 01:03:54,237
As expected.

849
01:03:54,239 --> 01:03:55,806
How long have you
been plotting this?

850
01:03:55,808 --> 01:03:58,309
Stop talking like that,
I'm your son!

851
01:03:58,311 --> 01:03:59,913
I'm your son!

852
01:04:00,246 --> 01:04:01,315
Scott?

853
01:04:02,081 --> 01:04:03,650
Scott!

854
01:04:05,451 --> 01:04:06,919
Dad...

855
01:04:10,356 --> 01:04:14,262
Dad... Scott...
Dad, stop, please.

856
01:04:20,434 --> 01:04:22,102
Nick!

857
01:04:25,772 --> 01:04:26,874
Let me out!

858
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:29,173
My own son,
a sleeper agent.

859
01:04:29,175 --> 01:04:31,376
Was it Annji, Nick?
Did she turn you?

860
01:04:31,378 --> 01:04:32,846
Look,
I think he's had enough.

861
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:34,083
He doesn't know anything!

862
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,252
There's something
else going on.

863
01:04:37,252 --> 01:04:40,089
Look at the phone.
Just look at the phone.

864
01:04:48,295 --> 01:04:51,132
All of this started
after you came back.

865
01:04:53,067 --> 01:04:54,199
I don't trust you anymore,
Nick.

866
01:04:54,201 --> 01:04:54,900
I don't trust you.

867
01:04:54,902 --> 01:04:56,235
You don't have
to trust me.

868
01:04:56,237 --> 01:04:58,041
Just watch the clip.

869
01:05:05,081 --> 01:05:06,182
Don't!

870
01:05:07,916 --> 01:05:10,818
I won't let any
of this nonsense

871
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:12,486
put me off anymore.

872
01:05:12,488 --> 01:05:15,256
We'll take an eye.
That will make him talk.

873
01:05:15,258 --> 01:05:17,091
T-Tony are you sure?

874
01:05:17,093 --> 01:05:18,495
I mean,
that's that's his eye!

875
01:05:19,961 --> 01:05:21,328
Fuck!

876
01:05:21,330 --> 01:05:22,999
You don't get it,
do you?

877
01:05:23,466 --> 01:05:26,103
It's a twisted
fucking experiment.

878
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:29,040
We've done this to ourselves.

879
01:05:32,176 --> 01:05:35,877
Don't let them
manipulate you.

880
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:38,813
You were always too clever
for your own good.

881
01:05:42,219 --> 01:05:44,121
Tony!

882
01:05:48,992 --> 01:05:50,362
She's dead.

883
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:54,396
My Kate is dead.

884
01:05:54,398 --> 01:05:56,901
No... No!
She's not!

885
01:06:27,131 --> 01:06:29,501
This changes nothing.

886
01:06:31,270 --> 01:06:34,208
In... In war there are
always casualties.

887
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,479
You fucking arrogant fool!

888
01:06:41,481 --> 01:06:43,014
All these years together

889
01:06:43,016 --> 01:06:46,351
you have never
listened to anyone else!

890
01:06:46,353 --> 01:06:48,255
I hate you!

891
01:07:19,086 --> 01:07:20,355
Okay.

892
01:07:24,692 --> 01:07:27,095
It's alright, don't worry.

893
01:07:31,699 --> 01:07:34,367
Okay. Careful.

894
01:07:34,369 --> 01:07:35,972
Easy, easy, easy.

895
01:07:39,107 --> 01:07:40,976
Just gently.

896
01:07:42,043 --> 01:07:44,580
I am so sorry, love.
I'm so sorry.

897
01:09:41,201 --> 01:09:42,470
Ah!

898
01:09:52,513 --> 01:09:53,715
Annji!

899
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:57,519
Annji, you're in danger!
Get back!

900
01:10:07,761 --> 01:10:09,131
Nick, hurry!

901
01:10:10,399 --> 01:10:12,368
Skull and crossbones
are appearing in the rooms!

902
01:10:13,502 --> 01:10:15,338
Okay... the key.

903
01:10:16,105 --> 01:10:17,507
Scott, get Dad's key!

904
01:10:18,573 --> 01:10:20,272
Tony, where are the keys
to the guest room?

905
01:10:20,274 --> 01:10:22,108
Think Tony, come on.
The keys!

906
01:10:22,110 --> 01:10:23,710
- I don't know.
- Think, Tony!

907
01:10:23,712 --> 01:10:25,681
There's a spare set
in the kitchen.

908
01:10:33,722 --> 01:10:34,725
Scott?

909
01:10:35,424 --> 01:10:36,659
Nick?

910
01:10:37,427 --> 01:10:38,261
Nick?

911
01:10:39,128 --> 01:10:41,528
Hello?
Is anyone out there?

912
01:10:41,530 --> 01:10:43,433
Nick, can you hear me?

913
01:10:52,741 --> 01:10:53,875
Scott, come on!

914
01:10:53,877 --> 01:10:54,812
Got them!

915
01:10:57,147 --> 01:10:58,415
Hurry, Scott!

916
01:11:00,851 --> 01:11:02,087
Nick?

917
01:11:14,798 --> 01:11:16,434
Fuck.

918
01:11:18,501 --> 01:11:19,771
Nick?

919
01:11:21,572 --> 01:11:22,841
- Mum?
- Nick!

920
01:11:23,508 --> 01:11:25,475
Nick, the doors jammed
I can't open it!

921
01:11:25,477 --> 01:11:27,709
Okay, just pull the handle
and I'll push. Okay?

922
01:11:27,711 --> 01:11:29,378
Nick,
there's smoke coming in!

923
01:11:29,380 --> 01:11:30,680
Give me your cardigan.

924
01:11:30,682 --> 01:11:31,847
Nick!

925
01:11:31,849 --> 01:11:34,717
Oh! Nick! Nick!

926
01:11:34,719 --> 01:11:36,455
Give me your cardigan!
Quick!

927
01:11:37,188 --> 01:11:38,387
Mum, just get back
from the glass.

928
01:11:38,389 --> 01:11:39,491
Nick...

929
01:11:47,199 --> 01:11:47,898
Mum!

930
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:50,604
Nick... you have to go.

931
01:11:51,269 --> 01:11:52,068
No, Mum!

932
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,370
Mum, just get back
from the door!

933
01:11:53,372 --> 01:11:54,508
Please, Mum.

934
01:12:00,479 --> 01:12:03,981
Mum! Mum!
No! No!

935
01:12:03,983 --> 01:12:07,550
Ah!
Mum! Mum! Mum!

936
01:12:07,552 --> 01:12:09,220
- Nick, we have to go!
- No!

937
01:12:09,222 --> 01:12:11,591
- We have to go!
- No! Mum! Mum!

938
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:23,401
Stuff the gaps!

939
01:12:23,403 --> 01:12:26,507
Dad, the smoke will kill us!
Fuck you!

940
01:12:37,919 --> 01:12:39,454
It's stopped!

941
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:56,371
This is bullshit.

942
01:12:59,642 --> 01:13:00,977
You're not the boss of us!

943
01:13:47,591 --> 01:13:48,960
Dad, what are you doing?

944
01:13:50,627 --> 01:13:51,929
Is this him?

945
01:13:53,364 --> 01:13:55,563
Have I been wrong
all this time?

946
01:13:55,565 --> 01:13:56,665
Whatever rubber band
was holding

947
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:58,099
your brain together
just snapped.

948
01:13:58,101 --> 01:13:59,067
Mum is dead.

949
01:13:59,069 --> 01:14:01,437
Dad, don't you care?!

950
01:14:01,439 --> 01:14:03,807
If this is you, Lord,
show us.

951
01:14:05,109 --> 01:14:07,579
Show us your hand
truly upon us.

952
01:14:11,717 --> 01:14:13,683
Kate's stomach moved!

953
01:14:13,685 --> 01:14:15,553
Don't be so fucking cruel.

954
01:14:16,088 --> 01:14:17,723
Good God.

955
01:14:20,726 --> 01:14:21,991
Her belly's still warm.

956
01:14:21,993 --> 01:14:22,992
The baby's still alive.

957
01:14:22,994 --> 01:14:24,861
W-we have to try
a C-section!

958
01:14:24,863 --> 01:14:26,565
This is the sign.

959
01:14:27,865 --> 01:14:29,601
The innocent is saved.

960
01:14:31,035 --> 01:14:32,703
We should give thanks.

961
01:14:32,705 --> 01:14:34,805
I'm not worshipping
that thing!

962
01:14:34,807 --> 01:14:37,010
Don't you see?
It's so clear now.

963
01:14:37,543 --> 01:14:39,379
We've were guided all along.

964
01:14:40,012 --> 01:14:41,982
Tested harshly, yes,

965
01:14:43,516 --> 01:14:45,018
but found worthy.

966
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:50,057
Those are our baby names.

967
01:14:51,891 --> 01:14:53,326
Scott, come on.

968
01:14:53,726 --> 01:14:55,830
Scott, if there's even
the slightest chance...

969
01:15:08,075 --> 01:15:12,045
In the-in the room
I found an old TV.

970
01:15:12,645 --> 01:15:15,582
I opened the back of it...
there was something inside.

971
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:18,016
Something living.

972
01:15:18,018 --> 01:15:20,085
Like a creature?

973
01:15:20,087 --> 01:15:22,056
Like a heart beating.

974
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:25,924
What if that same thing
is in the TV out there?

975
01:15:25,926 --> 01:15:28,396
What if it's in every TV?

976
01:15:29,464 --> 01:15:31,864
We believe in the true Lord,
Jesus Christ.

977
01:15:31,866 --> 01:15:33,633
The only son of God.

978
01:15:33,635 --> 01:15:35,802
God from God.
Light from light.

979
01:15:35,804 --> 01:15:37,536
True God from true God.

980
01:15:37,538 --> 01:15:39,605
Who was crucified
by Pontius Pilate,

981
01:15:39,607 --> 01:15:41,107
and on the third day
rose up again,

982
01:15:41,109 --> 01:15:44,047
in fulfillment of his brisk
journey to heaven...

983
01:15:45,448 --> 01:15:46,746
...but he will rise up again,

984
01:15:46,748 --> 01:15:48,215
and he will rise up
in full glory

985
01:15:48,217 --> 01:15:50,082
and judge the living
and he will judge the dead

986
01:15:50,084 --> 01:15:52,652
and his kingdom
will last forever.

987
01:15:52,654 --> 01:15:54,987
From the darkness
of the valley

988
01:15:54,989 --> 01:15:57,224
we've rescinded
into salvation,

989
01:15:57,226 --> 01:16:00,096
revelation, rebirth.

990
01:16:44,808 --> 01:16:46,675
Ah!
No, ah!

991
01:16:46,677 --> 01:16:48,177
Annji!

992
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:49,011
Let go!

993
01:16:49,013 --> 01:16:50,782
No! No! No!

994
01:16:51,048 --> 01:16:52,818
Dad, please, don't!

995
01:16:53,518 --> 01:16:55,583
No. No.
No, please don't...

996
01:16:55,585 --> 01:16:57,924
- No, ah!
- Dad, please!

997
01:16:58,156 --> 01:16:59,759
Dad, please don't do this!

998
01:17:00,291 --> 01:17:01,991
Scott, I swear to you.

999
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,893
I'm the only chance
for your child.

1000
01:17:03,895 --> 01:17:05,697
Let me perform a cesarean.

1001
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:08,632
She needs you.

1002
01:17:08,634 --> 01:17:10,703
Come on, Scott.
Come on.

1003
01:17:12,638 --> 01:17:14,105
Easy, Dad.

1004
01:17:19,979 --> 01:17:20,847
Go!

1005
01:17:21,780 --> 01:17:23,484
Go!
Be quick!

1006
01:17:30,657 --> 01:17:32,693
Cut it out!
Do it now!

1007
01:17:38,631 --> 01:17:39,932
Stop him first!

1008
01:17:41,301 --> 01:17:42,870
Scott!

1009
01:17:43,302 --> 01:17:44,305
Go!

1010
01:17:48,174 --> 01:17:49,308
Scott! No!

1011
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,655
We have to follow the rules.

1012
01:18:13,668 --> 01:18:14,969
Ah!

1013
01:18:16,303 --> 01:18:17,572
Annji!

1014
01:18:32,087 --> 01:18:33,854
You could never just do
what you were told,

1015
01:18:33,856 --> 01:18:34,558
could you, Nick?

1016
01:19:03,854 --> 01:19:04,989
Ah!

1017
01:19:19,269 --> 01:19:21,006
You had no choice.

1018
01:19:34,217 --> 01:19:35,287
Ah!

1019
01:19:52,036 --> 01:19:53,772
What the fuck is that?

1020
01:20:06,951 --> 01:20:08,155
Ah!

1021
01:21:06,515 --> 01:21:09,418
Ah! Fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!

1022
01:21:22,999 --> 01:21:24,367
Go! Go!

1023
01:21:38,414 --> 01:21:40,117
Go! Go!

1024
01:22:12,550 --> 01:22:14,419
It's okay. it's okay.

1025
01:22:16,520 --> 01:22:18,223
Ah!

1026
01:22:21,925 --> 01:22:23,461
Nick.

1027
01:22:31,436 --> 01:22:33,372
Nick.

1028
01:22:35,241 --> 01:22:36,442
You're not my Dad.

1029
01:22:37,509 --> 01:22:40,579
Worship me.

1030
01:22:41,212 --> 01:22:43,448
Worship me.

1031
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:49,588
Now or face your extinction.

1032
01:22:56,562 --> 01:22:58,132
This is bullshit!

1033
01:22:58,964 --> 01:23:00,834
Nick, what are you doing?

1034
01:23:01,901 --> 01:23:03,203
Do it!

1035
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:08,843
Come on, kill me!

1036
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:17,952
Join with me.

1037
01:23:19,920 --> 01:23:23,258
Become me.

1038
01:23:29,129 --> 01:23:30,632
It can't kill us.

1039
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:33,235
It needs us.

1040
01:23:34,235 --> 01:23:35,971
It's a parasite

1041
01:23:37,038 --> 01:23:39,107
and we're the only ones left.

1042
01:24:21,384 --> 01:24:22,685
Ah!

1043
01:24:34,364 --> 01:24:36,099
Argh!

1044
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:50,468
