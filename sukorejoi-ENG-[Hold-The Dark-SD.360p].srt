[female voice] Dear Mr. Core,

00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,452
three days ago

7
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,122
my son Bailey was taken by wolves.

8
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,711
This happened twice already here.

00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,047
No one in the village will hunt them,

10
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:54,883
and I am alone here now.

I know you have done this before.

14
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:04,767
In my heart...

15
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:08,354
I know that you are able to do it now.

18
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,783
Come and kill it to help me.

19
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:25,872
I know you have sympathy for this animal.

20
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,250
Please don't.

21
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:34,589
My husband will come home
from the war soon.

22
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,134
I must have something to show him.

I didn't think you'd really come.

I guess I was gonna try anything.

33
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,363
I'm very sorry about your boy, Mrs. Slone.

34
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:48,199
So, you've come to kill it?

35
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,744
To kill the one that took him.

36
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,455
I came to help if I can.

37
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,793
To explain this, if I can.

38
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,796
You've hunted and killed one before.

[Russell sighs]

41

I'd have killed it myself
if I'd found it.

42
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,433
I tried to find it.

43
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,771
That pack could be eight or ten members.
You don't want to find that.

44
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,985
Can I ask you a personal question?

45
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,030
Do you have a child?

46
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,535
Yes.

47
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,162
A daughter.

48
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:38,708
She's teaching at a university
down in Anchorage.

49
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:40,918
She wanted to be in Alaska.

50
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,923
That city is not Alaska.

what's outside those windows?

Your husband... He was notified?

57
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,674
The men were supposed to contact him.

58
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:33,596
I said I'd call, but I didn't.

59
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:36,682
I can't.

60

the children were taken.

Are those your only boots?

Yeah. That's all I have.

You're gonna need better boots.

[Russell]
You met your husband in the village?

68
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,797
[Medora] I didn't meet him anywhere.

69
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,590
I knew him my whole life.

70
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,759
I don't have a memory he isn't in.

71
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,178
And he left me here.

72
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,264
With a sick child.

73
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,182
[Russell] Well, the war...

74
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:21,852
Someone on the radio said
it's not a real war.

75
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:23,980
[Russell] Ah, it's real enough.
People are dying.

76
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,191
He said he'd never leave me.

77
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,820
Words can be worthless like that.

78
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,908
That's where the first boy was taken.

79
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,954
After that, they had men
with rifles on the high points,

80
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,998
and they'd walk the children to school.

81
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,002
Didn't matter for Bailey.

82
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,133
The second was a girl, here.

83
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,301
Cheeon's daughter.

84
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,928
She was sledding
and the wolf came up behind her.

85
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,930
From the north again.

86
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,642
Does Cheeon live nearby?

87
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:03,477
Yes.

88
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,771
My husband's friend.

89
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,774
Do you suppose I could speak with him?

90
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,776
No.

91
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:12,820
I don't suppose you could.

92
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,493
What did it feel like
to shoot that female wolf?

93
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,291
It felt awful.

94
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,126
But...

95
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:30,338
I really had no choice.

96
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:35,343
Even though she'd taken a child, too?

97
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:42,642
Because you think it's the natural order?

98
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,853
The natural order doesn't warrant revenge.

99

There's a hot springs not so far.
A few hours walking.

That's as close as I can get to warmth.

by next year.

504
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:33,382
You watch.

505
01:07:36,761 --> 01:07:38,220
Those bastards at the morgue.

506
01:07:40,097 --> 01:07:41,932
Bastards like you and me.

507
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,895
When we're killed,

508
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:47,354
the past is killed.

509
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:50,316
When kids are killed...

510
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,195
that's different.

511
01:07:57,406 --> 01:07:59,408
When kids are killed, the future dies.

512
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,161
There's no life without a future.

513
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,330
Cheeon. Please.

514
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,382
Those boys look like they don't know
whether to shit or piss.

515
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,179
I'm not going to lie to you.

516
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,432
Most of 'em are green.

517
01:08:25,309 --> 01:08:27,228
They've never seen anything
like this before.

518
01:08:27,311 --> 01:08:30,022
They are scared to death
and that is dangerous for you.

519
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:31,023
Oh, like what?

520
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:32,650
Come out with your hands up?

521
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:33,609
Like that, guy?

522
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,612
Listen here.

523
01:08:41,033 --> 01:08:42,368
That's never gonna happen.

524
01:08:50,084 --> 01:08:51,919
I promise I'll make everything fair.

That's good.

528
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:13,524
Think about what I offered.

529
01:09:16,527 --> 01:09:19,363
You think about the phone call
your wife will get today.

530
01:09:20,447 --> 01:09:21,574
Her hand on her belly.

531

-He said, "Fuck you." That's what he said.
-Jesus Christ.

01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:44,889
Okay, now what? I got to...

536
01:09:47,057 --> 01:09:49,727
I got to wait for Holy Cross
to send a tactical unit up.

537
01:09:50,311 --> 01:09:52,062
That's two hours out, boss.

01:24:41,409 --> 01:24:42,243
43. Fogey, huh?

672
01:24:45,997 --> 01:24:46,915
I'd trade you.

673
01:24:53,338 --> 01:24:54,172
You a father? Yes.

674
01:25:00,053 --> 01:25:00,929
What's that like?

675
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,182
Amazing.

676
01:25:09,187 --> 01:25:11,523
I wish I'd understood that
better at the time.

677
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:13,900
I guess I...

678
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:16,820
I guess I wasn't much help to her.

679
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:21,741
You like to think you're devoted
to your child.

680
01:25:22,700 --> 01:25:25,870
And you tell people this,
"I'd do anything for 'em, anything."

681
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:27,789
And...

682
01:25:29,666 --> 01:25:33,044
it feels correct in your mouth
when you say it, but...

683
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:37,298
And you just go ahead with your life.

684
01:25:39,926 --> 01:25:41,427
She's in Anchorage now,

685
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:42,470
a teacher.

686
01:25:44,556 --> 01:25:47,142
That's part of why I came here.

687
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:48,768
I...

688
01:25:49,269 --> 01:25:50,979
was hoping I'd be able to see her. But... Well...

689
01:25:57,402 --> 01:25:58,236
We'll see.

690
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:04,492
How are you from this region, I wonder?

691
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:07,662
You look Nordic to me.

692
01:26:08,788 --> 01:26:09,622
Woman, too.

693
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:12,667
[man] Same hair as you.

694
01:26:13,459 --> 01:26:14,586
Same eyes.

695
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,841
She knows you're coming for her.

696
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:23,469
You let her go from here?

697
01:26:25,096 --> 01:26:26,931
I've seen mothers kill their young.

698
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:28,683
See it out here a lot.

699
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:32,353
Ain't no decree in the country.
It don't reach here.

700
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,608
I help who comes asking.

701
01:26:41,779 --> 01:26:43,531
I remember you, traveler.

702
01:26:44,616 --> 01:26:46,910
Just a little tyke last time you was here.

703
01:26:46,993 --> 01:26:47,952
Sure.

704
01:26:48,786 --> 01:26:49,704
Why did we come?

705
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:50,788
To see me.

706
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:53,541
Your daddy wanted wolf's oil.

707
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:55,627
For you. Do you know that?

708
01:26:56,961 --> 01:26:58,171
He said you was...

709
01:26:59,088 --> 01:26:59,964
"unnatural."

710
01:27:00,048 --> 01:27:01,174
That was his word.

711
01:27:02,300 --> 01:27:03,301
Unnatural.

712
01:27:07,222 --> 01:27:10,516
An Indian witch from his village said
wolf's oil could cure you.

713
01:27:12,018 --> 01:27:12,894
Did it work?

714
01:27:13,811 --> 01:27:14,979
I gave him the oil.

715
01:27:17,232 --> 01:27:18,066
Where'd she go?

716
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,401
Not my business.

717
01:27:21,819 --> 01:27:23,738
Fixed her up with some boots I'd made.

718
01:27:27,742 --> 01:27:29,369
She left her mask, though.

719
01:27:31,871 --> 01:27:33,289
I don't know how she got it.

720
01:27:34,165 --> 01:27:37,377
I share 'em with travelers
and they find a way to who needs 'em.

721
01:27:39,254 --> 01:27:41,089
You are welcome to one, boy.

722
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:56,145
When was the last time you wore a mask?

723
01:28:19,794 --> 01:28:21,921
I can see you need
to let the wolf out a little.

724
01:28:26,342 --> 01:28:27,635
They all do out here.

725
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:29,762
It's true. It's truth.

[strained] Get me Cheeon.

742
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:37,283
Cheeon?

743
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,286
Where the fuck you been, man?

744
01:31:44,040 --> 01:31:45,374
I'm sorry, man.

01:31:47,376 --> 01:31:48,961
I know you two were close.

Cheeon never did like cops, but goddamn...

747
01:31:53,966 --> 01:31:55,927
Made himself a bloodbath up there.

748

Bailey.

750
01:32:04,018 --> 01:32:07,188
They said that on the news.
It's just a fucking nightmare, man.

It's just senseless.

[Shan] Fuck.

753
01:32:16,822 --> 01:32:18,157
So, who shot you?

754
01:32:20,576 --> 01:32:21,452
A woman.

755
01:32:22,370 --> 01:32:23,204
[Shan] Yeah, well...

756
01:32:24,288 --> 01:32:26,207
Who ain't been shot by a woman, right?

757
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:30,253
Here you go. Take these.

758
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,171
Come on.

759
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:38,719
Pull on this.

760

It's gonna hurt like a motherfucker.

Don't worry, Vern.

We'll get you fixed up.

763
01:32:49,855 --> 01:32:51,232
Get some hot soup in you.

764
01:32:51,315 --> 01:32:52,358
What kind?

765
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:54,944
What?

766
01:32:55,736 --> 01:32:56,821
What kind of soup?

767
01:32:59,532 --> 01:33:00,700
Campbell's chicken.

768
01:33:02,702 --> 01:33:03,703
I like tomato.

01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,583

like that today?

Kicked in a meth lab once.

774
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:35,860
Guy took a couple shots at me with a .22.

775
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:37,445
Purse gun.

776
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:39,322
Sounded like bubble wrap.

777
01:33:40,656 --> 01:33:41,782
He missed every shot.

778
01:33:43,618 --> 01:33:45,411
Never been so scared in my life.

779
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:46,746
But...

780
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:53,127
No, I've never seen anything like today.

781
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:05,097
Well...

782
01:34:05,765 --> 01:34:07,266
you handled yourself.

783
01:34:11,354 --> 01:34:12,938
I gave him what he wanted.

784
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,781
Slone killed that old woman.

785
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:26,619
Yeah. Why?

786
01:34:31,248 --> 01:34:34,377
I can't presume to know what goes
through Vernon Slone's head.

787
01:34:36,170 --> 01:34:37,213
Why any of it?

788
01:34:39,215 --> 01:34:41,092
Why did Medora do what she did?

789
01:34:42,218 --> 01:34:44,053
I'm not convinced the answers exist.

790
01:34:44,345 --> 01:34:45,179
They do.

791
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,769
Whether or not they fit
in our experience is another matter.

792
01:34:54,897 --> 01:34:55,815
What do you think?

793
01:34:58,609 --> 01:34:59,819
I'm no cop.

794
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:04,824

It's like she wanted to fix him.

796

Save him. I don't know.

797
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,626
Save him by destroying.

798
01:35:17,837 --> 01:35:19,213
It happens in medicine.

803
01:35:31,851 --> 01:35:32,685
In him.

804
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,563
Outside her window.

805
01:35:39,316 --> 01:35:40,985
She told me about it, but...

806
01:35:43,821 --> 01:35:44,780
I wasn't listening.

807
01:35:46,657 --> 01:35:48,492
I think that's why she wrote me.

808
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:52,246
She wanted a witness to tell her story.

809
01:35:53,664 --> 01:35:54,498
And...

810
01:35:57,334 --> 01:35:58,419
to be punished.

811
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:07,178
Well, you're the story guy.

812
01:36:09,555 --> 01:36:10,931
And as for the second part.

813
01:36:13,142 --> 01:36:15,728
All she had to do was wait
for Vernon to get home.

814
01:36:17,354 --> 01:36:19,273
And if he gets to her before we do...

815

I can't tell from this.

827
01:37:18,541 --> 01:37:20,417
It was north of Keelut.

828
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,088
But I'm not sure how long
I'd been walking.

829
01:37:25,673 --> 01:37:27,174
I think it's worth the chance.

just as good as finding him.

No, he is passed out,
but I don't know for how long,

Fuck is that?
It's Christmas not Halloween.

841
01:39:03,479 --> 01:39:05,940
Get back in bed.
You'll start bleeding again.

842
01:39:12,029 --> 01:39:13,155
I'm in trouble, Vern.

843
01:39:15,366 --> 01:39:17,076
It's those pills. I'm fucked up.

844
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:18,827
They got me

845
01:39:19,411 --> 01:39:20,871
and I'm looking at real time,

846
01:39:21,830 --> 01:39:23,624
but I was gonna wake you up.

847
01:39:24,208 --> 01:39:26,126
I'd get my good citizen points,

848
01:39:26,210 --> 01:39:28,921
and you'd be gone before they got here.

849
01:39:29,004 --> 01:39:30,089
So it's no harm done.

850
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:36,595
Hey. I saved your life, motherfucker.

851

Okay?

852
01:39:37,805 --> 01:39:39,264
You came. You asked for help.

853
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:40,265
And I helped you.

854
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:41,725
After what you did?

855
01:39:47,398 --> 01:39:49,525
We've known each other since we were kids.

856
01:39:52,069 --> 01:39:53,112
Okay. Fuck you.

857

Gimme a second? Hey, guys!

862
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:28,689
Are you headed for the Kennebeck Camp?

01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:38,032
[indistinct conversation]

864

[Russell] Is it just us?

867
01:40:51,378 --> 01:40:53,922
An old KA of Slone's
was found this morning

868
01:40:54,256 --> 01:40:55,758
with a mail slot in his skull.

869
01:40:58,719 --> 01:41:00,846
Half the guys are going to help with that.

870
01:41:01,764 --> 01:41:04,516
The other half are going
to the camp search, so yeah.

871
01:41:05,642 --> 01:41:06,643
I'm afraid,

01:41:07,227 --> 01:41:08,103
it's just us.

873
01:41:09,646 --> 01:41:11,273
You eyeball it. I'll call it in.

874
01:41:17,279 --> 01:41:18,113
Besides,

875
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:20,115
there's only two seats in this sucker.

876
01:41:23,786 --> 01:41:24,620

You see anybody?

884
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,580
Not our lady.

885
01:43:34,499 --> 01:43:35,459
I could loop back.

886
01:43:40,923 --> 01:43:41,757
Wait...

887
01:43:44,843 --> 01:43:46,094
Down in that ravine.

That's it.

889
01:43:51,683 --> 01:43:53,143
I can set us down on the ice.

[Russell] Not far, I'd guess.
